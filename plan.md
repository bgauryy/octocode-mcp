Key Findings
Current State of Octocode-MCP
✅ Has solid foundation with PAT-based authentication via tokenManager.ts
✅ Existing enterprise security features (audit logging, rate limiting, organization validation)
✅ Secure credential storage system
❌ Missing OAuth 2.0/2.1 authentication flows
❌ Missing GitHub App authentication support
GitHub MCP Server Reference
✅ Full OAuth 2.0 implementation with enterprise support
✅ GitHub App authentication with installation tokens
✅ Remote server capabilities (HTTP/SSE transport)
✅ MCP Authorization Protocol compliance
Implementation Plan Highlights
🎯 Focus: OAuth & Enterprise Authentication ONLY
The plan focuses exclusively on enhancing octocode-mcp's authentication capabilities without duplicating the GitHub MCP server's functionality.
Phase 1: OAuth Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Create OAuthManager with PKCE support (RFC 7636 compliant)
Implement secure token exchange and refresh
Enhance existing tokenManager.ts with OAuth token priority
Add OAuth configuration to server config
Phase 2: GitHub App Authentication (Week 2)
Create GitHubAppManager with JWT-based app authentication
Implement installation token management with caching
Add fine-grained permission and repository validation
Support multi-installation scenarios
Phase 3: Enterprise Security Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
Enhanced policy framework for OAuth/GitHub App authentication
Token security policies and validation
Enhanced audit logging for authentication events
Multi-organization support improvements
Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 5-6)
End-to-end OAuth integration testing
Security audits and penetration testing
Performance optimization
Migration utilities and documentation
Key Technical Features
OAuth 2.0/2.1 Implementation
PKCE parameter generation for security
Cryptographically secure state validation
Automatic token refresh with retry logic
GitHub Enterprise Server URL support
GitHub App Authentication
JWT generation for app authentication (RFC 7519)
Installation token caching with expiration
Fine-grained permission validation
Repository access control
Enhanced Token Management
Token priority: OAuth > GitHub App > Environment > CLI
Automatic token refresh scheduling
Secure token storage using existing credentialStore.ts
Enterprise audit logging integration
Environment Configuration
The plan includes comprehensive environment variable configuration for:
OAuth client credentials and settings
GitHub App configuration
Enterprise security policies
Token security settings
Risk Mitigation
Backward Compatibility: Existing PAT authentication remains functional
Security First: Comprehensive security audits and testing
Migration Support: Automated migration tools and rollback capabilities
Enterprise Focus: Close collaboration with enterprise customers
The plan provides a structured, phased approach to implementing enterprise-grade OAuth authentication while maintaining octocode-mcp's existing functionality and unique features.
