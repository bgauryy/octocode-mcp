# Octocode MCP Benchmark Prompts

This document contains a comprehensive set of benchmark prompts designed to test the advanced capabilities of the Octocode MCP tool. These prompts cover various aspects of code analysis, implementation comparison, architectural understanding, and deep technical exploration.

## Benchmark Test Queries

### React Concurrent Rendering Analysis
**Prompt:** Explain React's concurrent rendering implementation including scheduler and fiber architecture. Analyze the core algorithms, data structures, and design patterns used in the implementation. Include performance optimizations and trade-offs in the design decisions.

### Vue 3 Reactivity System Analysis
**Prompt:** How does Vue 3's reactivity system work with proxies and effect tracking? Analyze the implementation details of the reactivity system, including proxy-based reactivity, effect tracking mechanisms, and dependency collection. Compare with Vue 2's Object.defineProperty approach and examine the performance implications.

### Angular Dependency Injection Analysis
**Prompt:** Analyze Angular's dependency injection system and hierarchical injectors. How does it handle service instantiation, dependency resolution, and scope management? Examine the implementation of hierarchical injectors, provider configuration, and circular dependency resolution. Compare with other DI approaches and analyze the architectural trade-offs.

### Concurrent Rendering Implementation Analysis
**Prompt:** How did React implement their concurrent rendering feature? How does it work internally? Compare this implementation with how Vue.js handles concurrent features. Analyze the architectural differences, performance implications, and developer experience trade-offs between the two approaches.

### State Management Evolution Analysis
**Prompt:** Trace the evolution of state management patterns in React ecosystem. Compare Redux, Zustand, Jotai, and React's built-in state management. Analyze the implementation differences, performance characteristics, bundle size impact, and identify when to use each approach based on actual code examples.

### Build Tool Architecture Comparison
**Prompt:** Analyze and compare the architecture of modern JavaScript build tools: Webpack, Vite, Turbopack, and esbuild. How do they handle module resolution, tree shaking, and hot module replacement? Examine their core algorithms, performance optimizations, and plugin systems.

### Database ORM Implementation Deep Dive
**Prompt:** Compare the implementation strategies of TypeORM, Prisma, and Drizzle ORM. How do they handle schema generation, query building, type safety, and migrations? Analyze their code generation techniques, runtime performance, and developer experience design decisions.

### GraphQL Implementation Analysis
**Prompt:** Examine how Apollo Client and Relay implement GraphQL caching, query optimization, and real-time subscriptions. Compare their normalized caching strategies, update mechanisms, and analyze the trade-offs in their architectural decisions. Include performance benchmarks and memory usage patterns.

### Micro-frontend Architecture Investigation
**Prompt:** Analyze different micro-frontend implementation approaches: Module Federation (Webpack), Single-SPA, and Qiankun. How do they handle module sharing, communication between applications, routing, and state management? Compare their isolation strategies and deployment patterns.

### Next.js Server Components Deep Analysis
**Prompt:** How does Next.js implement React Server Components? Analyze the compilation process, server-client boundary handling, streaming, and hydration mechanisms. Compare with traditional SSR approaches and examine the performance implications and developer experience improvements.

### Monorepo Tooling Implementation Study
**Prompt:** Compare the implementation strategies of Nx, Lerna, Rush, and Turborepo for monorepo management. How do they handle dependency graph analysis, incremental builds, task scheduling, and cache invalidation? Analyze their algorithms for affected project detection and build optimization.

### WebAssembly Integration Patterns
**Prompt:** Investigate how popular JavaScript libraries integrate WebAssembly for performance-critical operations. Analyze implementations in libraries like Parcel, SWC, or Figma's browser engine. How do they handle memory management, JavaScript-WASM interop, and fallback strategies? Compare performance benchmarks and examine the compilation toolchains.

## Testing Guidelines

When using these prompts to benchmark the tool:

1. **Depth of Analysis**: Evaluate how deeply the tool can analyze complex codebases and architectural patterns
2. **Cross-Repository Intelligence**: Test the tool's ability to compare implementations across different repositories
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify the correctness of technical explanations and code analysis
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Assess how well the tool understands domain-specific concepts and trade-offs
5. **Performance Insights**: Check if the tool can provide meaningful performance and architectural insights

## Expected Capabilities

A comprehensive code analysis tool should demonstrate:

- **Multi-repository analysis** across different ecosystems
- **Architectural pattern recognition** and comparison
- **Performance implication understanding**
- **Evolution tracking** of features and implementations
- **Deep technical insight** into algorithms and data structures
- **Cross-language/framework comparison** abilities
- **Real-world applicability** of findings and recommendations
