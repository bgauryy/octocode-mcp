Possibilities for gh search repos Query Construction
The gh search repos command is highly flexible, allowing you to combine keywords, specific qualifiers (filters), and boolean operators.

1. Simple Keyword Search (Implicit AND)

Description: Provide one or more keywords. GitHub will search these keywords in the repository's name, description, and README file. Multiple keywords are treated as an AND operation.
Example:
Bash

gh search repos cli shell
Meaning: Find repositories that contain both "cli" AND "shell".
2. Exact Phrase Search

Description: Enclose a phrase in double quotes to search for that exact sequence of words.
Example:
Bash

gh search repos "vim plugin"
Meaning: Find repositories that contain the exact phrase "vim plugin".
3. Single Filter/Qualifier

Description: Use a single command-line flag (--flag=value) to apply a specific filter.
Example:
Bash

gh search repos --language=python
Meaning: Find repositories written in "Python".
4. Multiple Filters (Implicit AND between Filters)

Description: Combine several command-line flags. All specified conditions must be met.
Example:
Bash

gh search repos --owner=microsoft --visibility=public
Meaning: Find repositories that are both owned by "microsoft" AND are "public".
5. Filtering with Numerical Ranges/Comparisons

Description: For numerical filters (stars, forks, issues, size, topics), use comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) or ranges (..).
Examples:
Greater than or equal to:
Bash

gh search repos --language=go --good-first-issues=">=10"
Meaning: Find Go repositories with 10 or more "good first issues".
Range:
Bash

gh search repos --stars="100..500"
Meaning: Find repositories with 100 to 500 stars (inclusive).
Greater than (no upper limit):
Bash

gh search repos --forks=">50"
Meaning: Find repositories with more than 50 forks.
6. Filtering with Date Ranges/Comparisons

Description: For date filters (--created, --updated), use dates, comparison operators, or ranges.
Examples:
After a date:
Bash

gh search repos --updated=">2024-01-01"
Meaning: Find repositories updated after January 1, 2024.
Between dates:
Bash

gh search repos --created="2023-01-01..2023-12-31"
Meaning: Find repositories created in 2023.
7. "OR" Logic within Specific Filters (Comma-Separated Values)

Description: For certain multi-value filters like --topic, --license, --owner, --visibility, and --match, you can provide a comma-separated list of values. This acts as an OR operation for that specific filter.
Examples:
Topics (OR):
Bash

gh search repos --topic=unix,terminal
Meaning: Find repositories with "unix" OR "terminal" as a topic (or both).
Visibility (OR):
Bash

gh search repos --visibility=public,internal
Meaning: Find repositories that are "public" OR "internal".
8. Exclusion (NOT Operator)

Description: Use the - (minus) prefix before a keyword or a qualifier to exclude results that match that term or condition.
Examples:
Exclude by topic:
Bash

gh search repos -- -topic:linux
Meaning: Find repositories that do not have "linux" as a topic. (Note the -- before -topic:linux to tell gh CLI that -topic:linux is part of the query, not a flag.)
Exclude archived:
Bash

gh search repos --archived=false
Meaning: Find repositories that are not archived. (This is a direct flag for archived:false).
Exclude a keyword:
Bash

gh search repos myproject -old
Meaning: Find repositories with "myproject" but not "old".
9. Combining Keywords and Filters (Implicit AND)

Description: You can freely combine general keywords with specific filters. All conditions are implicitly ANDed.
Example:
Bash

gh search repos web framework --language=javascript --stars=">1000"
Meaning: Find JavaScript web frameworks with more than 1000 stars. (Implicit AND between "web", "framework", language:javascript, and stars:>1000).
10. Explicit "OR" Logic (Using OR Keyword)

Description: For "OR" conditions between different keywords or qualifiers (or more complex logical groupings), use the uppercase OR keyword within the main query string. Parentheses () can be used for grouping.
Examples:
Keywords with OR:
Bash

gh search repos "python OR ruby"
Meaning: Find repositories containing "python" OR "ruby".
Qualifiers with OR (using standard GitHub search syntax in query):
Bash

gh search repos "language:Go OR language:Rust"
Meaning: Find repositories that are Go OR Rust.
Complex Grouping:
Bash

gh search repos "stars:>=500 (language:TypeScript OR topic:frontend)"
Meaning: Find repositories with at least 500 stars AND (are TypeScript OR have the "frontend" topic).
11. Restricting Search Fields (--match flag or in: qualifier)

Description: Specify which fields (name, description, readme) the keywords should be searched within.
Examples:
Using the flag (OR logic for fields):
Bash

gh search repos "github cli" --match=name,description
Meaning: Search for "github cli" only in the repository name OR description.
Using the qualifier directly in the query:
Bash

gh search repos "github cli in:name"
Meaning: Search for "github cli" only in the repository name.
In summary, gh search repos allows for powerful and flexible queries by combining:

Keywords: Simple words or quoted phrases.
Qualifiers: Specific --flag=value pairs (or qualifier:value in the main query string).
Numerical/Date Comparisons: >, <, >=, <=, ...
Boolean Operators:
Implicit AND (default between terms/flags).
Explicit OR (using OR keyword or commas for specific multi-value flags).
NOT (using - prefix).
Grouping: Parentheses () for complex logical expressions.
Mastering these combinations allows you to construct highly precise search queries on GitHub.
