gh search code Command Explained

The gh search code command allows you to search for code on GitHub.

Basic Usage:

gh search code <QUERY> [FLAGS]

    <QUERY>: This is what you're looking for. It can be:

        One or more words (e.g., react hook).

        A phrase enclosed in double quotes for an exact match (e.g., "error handling").

        If you provide multiple words, the search will look for files containing all those words.

    [FLAGS]: These are optional filters to narrow down your search. You can use zero or more flags, and they are added after your query. Flags use the format --flagName=value.

How Queries and Flags Work Together

Think of it like this:

    When you use multiple words in your QUERY (e.g., react hook useState), the command finds files that contain all those words.

    FLAGS act as additional filters. For example, --language=javascript will only show results from JavaScript files.

The more terms you add to your query, and the more flags you use, the fewer results you'll get, because you're making your search more specific.

Common Flags:

    --extension string: Filter by file extension (e.g., --extension=js).

    --filename string: Filter by filename (e.g., --filename=package.json).

    --language string: Filter by programming language (e.g., --language=python).

    --limit int: Set the maximum number of results (default is 30).

    --owner strings: Filter by repository owner (e.g., --owner=microsoft).

    --repo strings: Filter by repository name (e.g., --repo cli/cli).

    --web: Open the search results in your web browser.

Examples:

    Search for "react" and "lifecycle":
    Bash

gh search code react lifecycle

Search for the exact phrase "error handling":
Bash

gh search code "error handling"

Search for "deque" in Python files:
Bash

gh search code deque --language=python

Search for "cli" in repositories owned by the "microsoft" organization:
Bash

gh search code cli --owner=microsoft

Search for "panic" in the "cli/cli" repository:
Bash

gh search code panic --repo cli/cli

Search for "lint" in package.json files:
Bash

    gh search code lint --filename package.json
