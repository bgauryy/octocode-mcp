# Octocode MCP Architecture

`octocode-mcp` is a **thin MCP server**. It owns process lifecycle, tool
registration, and output safety. It owns **no** business logic, schemas, or tool
metadata. Execution lives in `@octocodeai/octocode-tools-core`; contracts live in
`@octocodeai/octocode-core`; native search/minify/LSP live in `octocode-engine`. The
MCP package wires those into the MCP SDK and runs them.

## Boundary

- **Transport**: MCP SDK v2 `StdioServerTransport` from
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio` (stdio only — no HTTP).
- **Entry**: `src/index.ts` → `startServer()` → stdio transport.
- **Public API**: `src/public.ts` is the declared package surface for programmatic
  consumers. It re-exports tools-core; workspace interfaces import tools-core
  directly. Internal `register*Tool` functions are intentionally absent.
- Import descriptions and schemas from core, and runners from tools-core.
  Keep data shaping in tools-core.

## Startup (`src/index.ts`)

`startServer()` runs a fixed sequence, then connects the transport:

1. `initialize()` — core bootstrap, including the persisted cache-maintenance due-check.
2. `configureSecurity()` + register `getOctocodeDir()` as an allowed root.
3. `initializeProviders()` — GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket.
5. `initializeSession()`, then `createServer()` + `registerAllTools()`.

After the transport connects, `startCacheGC()` schedules the next persisted maintenance deadline with an unreferenced timer. This is deadline-based scheduling from the shared 24-hour marker, not a fresh interval measured from each MCP start, so CLI and MCP processes observe the same gate. A cross-process lock prevents overlapping sweeps.

The server uses core's `buildMcpInstructions(enabledToolNames)` so instructions
match the configured tool subset.
Process handlers wire SIGINT/SIGTERM/STDIN-close/uncaught/unhandled to a single
`gracefulShutdown` that stops the cache-maintenance scheduler, clears runtime caches, and closes the server
within `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (5s) before exiting.

## Tool Registration (`src/tools/`)

- `toolConfig.ts` — maps tools-core's `ALL_TOOLS` runtime attachments
  through `createToolRegistration`, producing `ALL_TOOLS: McpToolConfig[]`.
- `toolsManager.ts` — `registerTools()`: wraps the server with output
  sanitization, filters tools (local/clone gates + filter config), then
  batch-registers and summarizes outcomes.
- `registrationExecutor.ts` — registers tools in parallel; per-tool failures are
  isolated and reported (`success` / `failed`), never fatal unless zero tools
  register.
- `toolFilters.ts` — `isLocal`/`isClone` capability gates plus
  `TOOLS_TO_RUN` (exclusive) vs `DISABLE_TOOLS` selection;
  `isDefault` tools register unless disabled.
- `registerTool.ts` — the single adapter for local and remote tools. It forwards
  the core-owned title, description, and input schema; selects the matching
  security boundary; and sets `openWorldHint` from the security class.

The public catalog is:

- **GitHub**: `ghSearch`, `ghGetFileContent`, `ghSearchHistory`,
  `ghGetHistoryItem`, and `ghCloneRepo`.
- **Package**: `artifactSearch`.
- **Local**: `localSearch`, `astSearch`, and `localFetch`.
- **LSP**: `lspSearch`.

## Output Safety (`src/utils/secureServer.ts`)

`withOutputSanitization()` is a `Proxy` over `McpServer` that intercepts
`registerTool`/`registerResource`. Every tool callback is wrapped so its result
is passed through `sanitizeCallToolResult` (secret masking via
`ContentSanitizer` + `maskSensitiveData`), and thrown errors are normalized,
sanitized, and converted to a safe tool error result instead of crashing the
server.

## Dependencies

There are two different dependency views:

- **Source/build**: `@octocodeai/octocode-tools-core` resolves to the workspace
  during local development. The MCP source imports its runners and shared
  utilities, and imports public contracts from core; `buildConfig.mjs` keeps runtime dependencies
  external in `dist/index.js` and `dist/public.js`.
- **Published runtime**: npm users install the direct dependencies declared in
  `package.json`: MCP SDK v2's `@modelcontextprotocol/server`, tools-core, and
  core, and Zod. Client SDK v2 is test-only. Tools-core owns its native-engine
  dependencies, including the matching platform addon.
- **Types**: `dist/public.d.ts` is bundled into one consumer-facing declaration
  file while tools-core remains an explicit runtime dependency.

Publish order follows the runtime graph: publish the engine platform packages,
then the engine root and tools-core, then `octocode-mcp`.

## Distribution Artifacts

`package.json#files` ships generated/static files alongside `dist/`:

- `README.md` — **not** hand-authored here. `yarn readme:sync` (runs before
  `build`/`build:dev`/`prepack`) copies the root `README.md` in via
  `scripts/sync-package-readmes.mjs`. Edit the root `README.md`, never this
  package's copy directly — it is gitignored and overwritten on every sync.
- `manifest.json` — Claude Desktop / DXT extension manifest. Declares the
  `mcp_octocode_*`-prefixed tool catalog, `user_config` fields, and platform
  compatibility for the desktop-extension install path.
- `server.json` — MCP registry submission (`io.github.bgauryy/octocode-mcp`),
  validated against the `2025-10-17` server schema. Declares the npm package
  identifier/version the registry resolves and the `env` vars a client may set.
- `LICENSE` — MIT, copied as-is.
- `dist/docs/` — a build-time copy of the repository-level developer and agent
  documentation. `scripts/bundle-docs.mjs` refreshes it on every MCP build so
  the published server carries the same docs without requiring a checkout.

`manifest.json` and `server.json` are **hand-maintained** — no build step syncs
their `version` or tool list from `package.json` or core's `ALL_TOOLS`. When
the tool catalog changes or a release ships, update both files' `version`
fields and `manifest.json#tools` alongside `package.json#version`.
`tests/packageRelease.test.ts` checks versions, canonical tool names, and
desktop setting interpolation. Runtime registration derives from tools-core.
