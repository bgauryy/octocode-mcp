## üéØ Who Is This For?

### For Developers
Navigate complex multi-repo architectures, understand organizational issues at scale, and generate custom documentation on-demand from real code examples. Create contextual documentation directly in your IDE, or ask OctoCode to learn from any repository and implement similar patterns in your current project.

### For Product & Engineering Managers
Gain unprecedented visibility into application behavior through semantic code search, track development progress across teams, and understand the real implementation behind product features.

### For Security Researchers
Discover security patterns, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues across both public and private repositories with advanced pattern matching and cross-codebase analysis.

### For Large Organizations
Dramatically increase development velocity by enabling teams to instantly learn from existing codebases, understand cross-team implementations, and replicate proven patterns‚Äîtransforming institutional knowledge into actionable development acceleration.

### For Beginners & Advanced Vibe Coders
- **Beginners**: Take code from anywhere and understand it deeply. Learn from production codebases, discover proven patterns, and build confidence by seeing how experienced developers solve problems.
- **Advanced Vibe Coders**: Leverage quality context for superior code generation. Use comprehensive understanding from issues, PRs, and documentation to generate production-ready code that follows established patterns.

## üöÄ Installation

**Octocode supports dual GitHub authentication** - works with both GitHub tokens and GitHub CLI for maximum flexibility.

### Quick Install
```bash
# Add to Claude Desktop (recommended)
claude mcp add octocode npx 'octocode-mcp@latest'
```

### Authentication Options

**Option 1: GitHub Token (Best for Production)**
1. Create token at [GitHub Settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add to MCP configuration:
```json
"octocode": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["octocode-mcp"],
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_YOUR_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

**Option 2: GitHub CLI (Best for Local Development)**
1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or `winget install GitHub.cli` (Windows)
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Add to MCP configuration:
```json
"octocode": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["octocode-mcp"]
}
```

**How It Works:**
- **Token Priority**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` ‚Üí `GH_TOKEN` ‚Üí GitHub CLI token (automatic fallback)
- **API Integration**: All GitHub operations use Octokit API with the retrieved token
- **CLI Integration**: GitHub CLI is used only for token retrieval, not for operations
- **Seamless Fallback**: Automatically switches between authentication methods

### Requirements
- **Node.js**: v20+
- **GitHub Authentication**: Token OR GitHub CLI
- **NPM (Optional)**: For package research

## üì¶ DXT Extension

This project is available as a **Desktop Extension (DXT)** for easy installation in AI applications like Claude Desktop.

### Quick DXT Setup

## üí° Best Practices & Prompting Guide

### üöÄ **Essential Prompting Patterns**

**1. Start with Octocode Context**
```
Use Octocode to research [your topic]. Do a deep research across repositories, 
PRs, commits, and documentation to generate comprehensive context.
```

**2. Private Organization Access**
```
Focus on repositories from "your-private-organization" organization. 
Analyze internal patterns and organizational best practices.
```

**3. Complex Flow Analysis**
```
Check package X from frontend, trace how it interacts with servers, 
and identify which database schema stores the audit trail. 
Map the complete data flow across repositories.
```

**4. Deep Research Directive**
```
Do a deep research - don't just find surface-level information. 
Analyze commits, PRs, issues, and actual implementations. 
Compare different approaches and extract proven patterns.
```

**5. Documentation Generation**
```
Create a comprehensive .md document from this research. 
Include code examples, architectural decisions, and implementation patterns. 
Use this documentation as context for further analysis.
```

**6. Follow-up Research Strategy**
```
Based on the previous research, now investigate [specific aspect]. 
Build upon the existing context rather than starting from scratch.
```

**7. PR Review with Rules**
```
Review this PR against our documented coding standards and security guidelines. 
Check for compliance with organizational patterns and best practices.
```

**8. Security & Pattern Auditing**
```
Scan our organization's repositories for security vulnerabilities and 
anti-patterns. Focus on authentication, data handling, and access controls.
```

### üéØ **Smart Prompting Strategy**

**Octocode is built with smart fallbacks and error handling** - it will guide you through research automatically. However, **if you know what you need, help it avoid wasting LLM context on redundant searching:**

#### ‚úÖ **Efficient Prompting**
- **Be Specific**: "Search for Redis caching patterns in TypeScript microservices" vs "Find caching examples"
- **Set Scope**: "Focus on repositories from organization 'company-name'" vs broad searches
- **Define Goals**: "Generate API documentation" vs "Research this API"
- **Use Context**: "Based on the previous research about auth patterns, now find rate limiting implementations"

#### ‚ùå **Avoid Context Waste**
- Don't repeat broad searches if you already have repository context
- Don't ask for general overviews when you need specific implementations
- Don't search across all repositories when you know the target organization
- Don't start from scratch if you have existing research context

### üîÑ **Progressive Research Workflow**

**Phase 1: Discovery & Context**
```
Use Octocode to discover repositories related to [topic] in [organization]. 
Focus on active projects with recent commits and good documentation.
```

**Phase 2: Deep Analysis**
```
From the discovered repositories, analyze the implementation patterns for [specific feature]. 
Get actual code examples, PR discussions, and commit history.
```

**Phase 3: Documentation & Synthesis**
```
Create comprehensive documentation from the research. Include:
- Architecture overview
- Code examples with explanations  
- Best practices and patterns
- Security considerations
```

**Phase 4: Application & Review**
```
Use the generated documentation to review [new code/PR/implementation]. 
Check for compliance with discovered patterns and organizational standards.
```

### üè¢ **Enterprise Research Patterns**

#### **Organization Intelligence**
- Map coding standards across teams
- Discover internal libraries and shared patterns
- Analyze architectural evolution over time
- Extract institutional knowledge from commit histories

#### **Security Auditing**
- Scan for vulnerability patterns across repositories
- Check compliance with security guidelines
- Analyze access control implementations
- Review authentication and authorization patterns

#### **Cross-Repository Analysis**
- Trace data flows between microservices
- Understand service dependencies and interactions
- Map API contracts and communication patterns
- Analyze deployment and infrastructure patterns
