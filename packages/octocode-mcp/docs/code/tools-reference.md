# Tools Reference

The detailed tool parameters, schemas, and response formats are maintained centrally in:

- `../../TOOL_SCHEMAS.md` – authoritative schema reference
- `../../DOCUMENTATION.md#available-tools` – usage-oriented descriptions and examples

Keeping those documents in sync prevents divergence between the package docs and the published documentation. Update the canonical files directly when tool contracts change, and link to them from here as needed.
