# @octocode/mcp Documentation

This folder previously replicated content from the main documentation set. To reduce drift between sources, use the canonical docs in the parent directory:

- `../INDEX.md` – top-level map of all documentation
- `../QUICK_START.md` – installation and configuration
- `../DOCUMENTATION.md` – comprehensive user guide
- `../ARCHITECTURE.md` – system design, diagrams, and internals
- `../TOOL_SCHEMAS.md` – authoritative schema definitions

### Why consolidate?

Maintaining parallel guides led to conflicting versions (for example, outdated tool names and package versions). The parent directory now owns the official references; this folder remains only to point existing links to the right place.

If you find a broken link or missing topic, update the canonical document instead of recreating it here.
