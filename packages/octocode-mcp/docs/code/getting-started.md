# Getting Started with @octocode/mcp

The step-by-step setup, configuration, and first-run guidance now lives in the canonical quick start documents:

- `../QUICK_START.md` – installation, configuration, workflows
- `../AUTHENTICATION.md` – token setup, scopes, troubleshooting

Refer to those files so we maintain one set of instructions for onboarding. If you notice gaps, update the quick start guide directly instead of reintroducing duplicated steps here.
