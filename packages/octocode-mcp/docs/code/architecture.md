# Architecture

The canonical architecture documentation moved to `../ARCHITECTURE.md` to avoid splitting the narrative between two files.

Use that document for:
- Layer-by-layer breakdowns and diagrams
- Extension and testing guidance
- Security, performance, and tooling details

If you need code-package specific notes that are not covered there, add them directly to `ARCHITECTURE.md` so we keep a single, maintained source.
