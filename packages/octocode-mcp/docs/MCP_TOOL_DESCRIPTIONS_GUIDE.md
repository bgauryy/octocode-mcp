## üéØ Overview

This guide provides recommendations for structuring MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool descriptions in Octocode-MCP. The goal is to create consistent, actionable, and AI-assistant-optimized descriptions that enhance tool orchestration and research workflows.

## üìã Context & Analysis

### Current State Analysis

**Issues Identified:**
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent Structure**: Mixed formats across tools (some use "PURPOSE:", others don't)
- ‚ùå **Too Technical**: Heavy focus on implementation details vs. user value proposition
- ‚ùå **Missing Tool Chaining**: Limited cross-tool integration guidance
- ‚ùå **Verbose Descriptions**: Some exceed optimal length for MCP protocol efficiency
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixed bullet styles, capitalization, section organization
- ‚ùå **Weak Value Proposition**: Unclear primary use cases and benefits

### System Context

**Octocode-MCP System Prompts Alignment:**
```
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (Chain-of-Thought):
- DISCOVERY PHASE: Start broad ‚Üí analyze patterns ‚Üí identify focus areas
- ANALYSIS PHASE: Deep-dive into promising areas ‚Üí extract insights ‚Üí cross-validate  
- SYNTHESIS PHASE: Compile findings ‚Üí identify patterns ‚Üí generate recommendations

EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:
- Bulk-First: Use multi-query operations for comprehensive coverage
- Progressive Refinement: Start broad, narrow based on findings
- Strategic Chaining: Follow tool relationships for optimal flow
```

**Tool descriptions must support this methodology and enable effective tool orchestration.**

## üèóÔ∏è Recommended Structure Template

### Standard Template
```typescript
const DESCRIPTION = `[ONE-LINE PURPOSE]: [What the tool does] with [key differentiator].

[2-3 sentence overview explaining value proposition and primary use cases]

FEATURES:
- [Core capability 1]: [Brief explanation with user benefit]
- [Core capability 2]: [Brief explanation with user benefit]
- [Core capability 3]: [Brief explanation with user benefit]
- [Bulk operations]: [Parallel processing capability]
- [Integration]: [Tool chaining and workflow integration]

BEST PRACTICES:
- [Strategic usage pattern 1]
- [Strategic usage pattern 2]  
- [Performance/efficiency guidance]
- [Research methodology alignment]

[OPTIONAL SECTIONS]:
SEARCH STRATEGY: [For search-focused tools]
BETA FEATURES: [For experimental capabilities]`;
```

### Key Principles

1. **Value-First**: Lead with what the tool accomplishes, not how it works
2. **Strategic Context**: Emphasize tool chaining and workflow integration
3. **Bulk-Oriented**: Highlight parallel operations as primary capability
4. **Research-Aligned**: Support discovery ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí synthesis methodology
5. **Concise Features**: 3-5 key capabilities, avoid exhaustive lists
6. **Actionable Practices**: Specific usage patterns, not generic advice

## üîÑ Before & After Comparisons

#### ‚ùå BEFORE (Current)
```typescript
const DESCRIPTION = `PURPOSE: Search code across GitHub repositories with strategic query planning.

  SEARCH STRATEGY:
    SEMANTIC: Natural language terms describing functionality, concepts, business logic
    TECHNICAL: Actual code terms, function names, class names, file patterns
    Use bulk queries from different angles. Start narrow, broaden if needed
    SEPERATE SEARCH SMART USING SEVERAL QUERIES IN BULK
    USE STRINGS WITH ONE WORD ONLY FOR EXPLORETORY SEARCH.
      EXAMPLE:
        queryTerms: [
            term1,
            term2
          ]
  FOR MORE CONTEXT AFTER GOOD FINDINGS:
        Use ${TOOL_NAMES.GITHUB_FETCH_CONTENT} with matchString for context.
        Use ${TOOL_NAMES.GITHUB_VIEW_REPO_STRUCTURE} to find the repository structure for relevant files after search

  Progressive queries: Core terms ‚Üí Specific patterns ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Alternatives`;
```

**Issues:**
- Inconsistent formatting and capitalization
- Too technical and implementation-focused
- Poor readability with nested indentation
