# Octocode-MCP Architecture Summary

This file previously duplicated the architecture reference. To keep one source of truth, detailed architecture, component, and workflow documentation now lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Where to Look

- For the full system design: see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- For day-to-day usage guidance: see `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `USAGE_GUIDE.md`.
- For environment setup and authentication: see `QUICK_START.md` and `AUTHENTICATION.md`.

If you discover gaps that are not covered in those canonical docs, open an issue so we can expand the primary references instead of reintroducing duplicates here.
