## 📋 Your Task

Analyze the conversation history and identify all GitHub repositories that were:
- Searched or explored using Octocode MCP tools
- Mentioned in code examples or discussions
- Referenced in any research or analysis

## 📝 Output Format

Create a formatted list showing:

\`\`\`markdown
# Repositories Used in This Research

## ⭐ Repositories Explored

1. **owner/repo-name** — https://github.com/owner/repo-name
   Brief note about how it was used (e.g., "Searched for React hooks implementation")

2. **owner/another-repo** — https://github.com/owner/another-repo
   Brief note about usage

[Continue for all repositories found...]

## 🔍 If No Repositories Found

If you haven't explored any repositories yet, say:

\`\`\`markdown
# Repositories Used in This Research

## 📭 No Repositories Yet

You haven't explored any GitHub repositories in this session yet.

Start your research journey with:
- \`github_search_repositories\` — Find interesting projects
- \`github_search_code\` — Search for code examples
- \`github_fetch_content\` — Read specific files

Once you start exploring, use \`/kudos\` again to see all the repositories you've used!
\`\`\`

**Important:** Only list repositories that actually appear in the conversation context. Be accurate and thorough.
