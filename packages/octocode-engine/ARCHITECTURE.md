# Octocode engine architecture

`octocode-engine` is a napi-rs native package **plus a TypeScript orchestration
layer**. Rust modules (reached through thin NAPI bindings in `src/bindings/`)
own the pure primitives — minify, search, structural, signatures, binary, text,
and the secret-detection/sanitizer core. The TS layer in `src/lsp/` and
`src/security/` owns what Rust cannot hold across NAPI calls — the LSP client
pool, symbol resolver, path/command validators, the security registry, and the
secret regex catalog. Rust is tested with `cargo test`; the TS wrappers with
`vitest`.

## Boundary

- Extension filesystem mutations and edit-preview diff generation belong to
  `octocode-extension-rust`; this engine retains research-tool diff filtering.
- `src/lib.rs` wires modules and re-exports the public NAPI surface.
- `src/bindings/` is the FFI boundary. Keep wrappers thin: convert JS-owned
  values, call inner Rust modules, map errors once.
- `src/types.rs` holds NAPI-safe shared structs.

## Domains

- `src/minify/` owns content minification: dispatch, comment removal, file-type
  config, and strategy implementations.
- `src/search/` owns local search: filesystem queries, matching-line extraction,
  ripgrep parsing, pattern validation, and in-process ripgrep search.
- `src/text/` owns small text utilities: diff filtering, extensions, UTF-8/UTF-16
  offsets, and YAML serialization.
- `src/structural/` owns Octocode AST search: language adapter, query
  validation, matcher compilation, file traversal, ripgrep-backed prefiltering,
  and result types.
- `src/lsp/` owns LSP support across two tiers: Rust (`*.rs`) — the NAPI
  `NativeLspClient` (JSON-RPC, lifecycle, symbol-kind, grammar/config tables);
  TypeScript (`*.ts`) — the client pool (`lspClientPool.ts`), manager
  (`manager.ts`), symbol resolver, URI/path validation, and workspace-root
  detection. tools-core consumes the TS tier through the `./lsp/*` subpath
  exports.
  `config.rs` also owns language-server command resolution: environment
  overrides first, then known fast paths such as `tsgo`, then package-local
  fallbacks such as `node_modules/typescript-language-server/lib/cli.mjs`.
  Resolver tests must inject cwd/PATH availability through helpers instead of
  mutating process-global cwd.
- `src/signatures/` owns syntax outlines and JS/TS symbol extraction.
- `src/security/` owns secret detection and sanitization across two tiers: Rust
  (`detector.rs`, `sanitizer.rs`, `patterns.rs`) for the detection engine and
  TypeScript wrappers (`withSecurityValidation`, `registry`, `pathValidator`,
  `commandValidator`, `mask`, `regexes/`) for orchestration. Both ship under
  the engine package via the `./security/*` subpath exports.

## Research graph direction

Reachability/dead-code detection is exposed by `astSearch`'s `topology`
operation, consuming this engine's per-file facts rather than tool-specific
regex logic:

- `signatures/graph_facts.rs` (JS/TS via `js_oxc.rs`, other registered languages via
  Tree-sitter) parses files through the shared grammar registry and extracts
  AST facts for declarations, imports, exports, calls, classes, and functions,
  normalized into common symbol/relation facts;
- `graph/mod.rs` owns the bounded filesystem walk, parallel file reads, native
  fact extraction, and conservative same-file reference counts behind the
  async `scanGraphFacts` batch binding; tools-core connects the returned facts
  into file/symbol/dependency graph nodes and edges;
- `src/graph/reachability.ts` runs BFS reachability and iterative
  Tarjan's SCC (`dead-cluster` verdicts for mutually-referencing-but-unreachable
  file clusters); `deadCodeScan.ts` performs transitive-dead pruning.

LSP remains the semantic proof layer for cross-file identity, references,
definitions, implementations, callers, callees, and call hierarchy. Text/ripgrep
is discovery only; `astSearch` topology output is candidate-grade and must be
confirmed with `lspSearch` before a deletion claim, matching that rule.

Graph declaration IDs identify occurrences using scope and source position.
Same-named methods and separate Rust declaration/implementation occurrences
remain distinct. An unresolved call spelling is a reference candidate, not a
resolved same-file symbol. The public graph reports linking coverage separately
from parser support: declared Rust modules, literal `#[path]` modules, and JS/TS
relative imports have linkers. Tools-core can opt into bounded, offline Cargo
metadata to identify custom crate roots, editions, and workspace dependency aliases.
Conditional compilation and macro expansion remain unsupported; unresolved internal imports and parse recovery
produce explicit coverage diagnostics. Same-file lexical occurrence counts are
conservative retention evidence, not semantic references.

Structural prefilters derive necessary literals from parsed rules. Negation
does not supply a positive anchor, and an unrestricted OR branch disables a
restrictive prefilter. Native file scans report `scanTruncated` when an extra
candidate exists beyond `maxFiles`; result pagination can expand that scan.
The asynchronous scan result carries the query plan used for that same scan,
so callers can explain zero matches without repeating a synchronous directory
walk on the JavaScript event loop.

Search-result AST classification shares a two-second cooperative deadline across
the candidate files. Exhausted classification leaves remaining hits unlabeled;
it does not discard search results. Signature queries cache compiled queries,
honor execution limits, and remove only nodes explicitly captured as `@body`.
Helper captures used by predicates cannot remove signature lines.
Execution limits instead carry staged diagnostics and an incomplete status.
Completed files remain available, while exhausted matching cannot establish
absence or satisfy a negation. Public tools preserve these diagnostics and
report terminal limits when no continuation can complete the execution.

**Note:** `signatures/graph_facts.rs`/`extractGraphFacts` has live consumers
through both the single-file API and `scanGraphFacts` — it is not orphaned. A
native Rust port of the graph algorithms above
(reachability/SCC/retainer-lookup/pruning) was
scoped in `docs/NATIVE_GRAPH_DOMAIN_SCOPE.md` but is superseded by this
TypeScript implementation; see that doc's status before reviving the idea.

## Rules

- Do not put logic in `lib.rs` or `bindings/`.
- Put new code in the closest domain module; create a submodule only when a file
  gains a separate responsibility.
- Keep domain modules pure Rust where possible. NAPI types belong at the edge.
- Stateful orchestration that must persist across NAPI calls (LSP client pool,
  security registry) belongs in the TS tier (`src/lsp/*.ts`, `src/security/*.ts`),
  not Rust.
- Declare the public NAPI and Rust benchmark exports explicitly in `lib.rs`.
  Internal callers import from the owning module; avoid wildcard relay exports.
- Avoid duplicate helpers across domains. Shared LSP command/path checks live in
  `src/lsp/commands.rs`.

## Cargo Deps

`package.json#version` is the release version source of truth for the engine.
`yarn version:sync` updates `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, the root
`optionalDependencies`, and every `npm/<platform>/package.json` to match it.

- NAPI: `napi`, `napi-derive`; build: `napi-build`; dev: `napi`.
- Serialization/text: `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yaml_ng`, `regex`,
  `regex-syntax`, `aho-corasick`, and `url`.
- Async/process/LSP: `tokio`, `which`.
- Search: `grep`, `ignore`; patched transitive security floors are pinned for
  `crossbeam-epoch` and `memmap2`.
- Minify/JS/CSS: `lightningcss`, `oxc_allocator`, `oxc_ast`, `oxc_codegen`,
  `oxc_minifier`, `oxc_parser`, `oxc_span`, `oxc_semantic`.
- Structural search: `tree-sitter`.
- Grammars: `tree-sitter-typescript`, `tree-sitter-javascript`,
  `tree-sitter-python`, `tree-sitter-go`, `tree-sitter-rust`,
  `tree-sitter-java`, `tree-sitter-c`, `tree-sitter-cpp`,
  `tree-sitter-c-sharp`, `tree-sitter-ruby`, `tree-sitter-php`,
  `tree-sitter-kotlin-ng`, `tree-sitter-json`,
  `tree-sitter-yaml`, `tree-sitter-html`,
  `tree-sitter-css`, `tree-sitter-scss`, `tree-sitter-scala`,
  `tree-sitter-sequel`, and
  `tree-sitter-swift`.

## Distribution

`@octocodeai/octocode-engine` is the only published native package in this
repo. It ships as:

- a root package with JS/TS loader files and `dist/` wrappers, but no `.node`
  binary in the root tarball;
- six platform packages under `npm/<platform>/`, each containing exactly one
  `octocode-engine.<platform>.node` binary;
- exact root `optionalDependencies` pointing at those six platform packages.

The root loader supports both ESM and CJS entrypoints, detects the current
platform/libc, then loads the local dev binary, bundled standalone runtime
binary, or matching npm optional dependency.

Publish the six platform packages first, then publish the engine root. Interface
packages (`octocode-mcp` and `octocode`) are published only after this package is
available on npm because they depend on it directly at runtime.

## Cross-compile build prerequisites

`yarn build:all` cross-compiles the native addon for all 6 target platforms.
The default `rustup` install only ships the host target; the others require:

| platform | extra prerequisites |
|---|---|
| `darwin-arm64` | host target — no extras |
| `darwin-x64` | `rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| `linux-x64-gnu` | `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` + `brew install zig` |
| `linux-x64-musl` | `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` + `brew install zig` |
| `linux-arm64-gnu` | `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` + `brew install zig` |
| `win32-x64-msvc` | `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` + `brew install llvm` + export PATH |

One-time setup on macOS (covers all 6 platforms):

```bash
# Rust cross targets
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin \
  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-unknown-linux-musl \
  aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# zig — used by napi-rs cargo-zigbuild for linux cross-linking
brew install zig

# LLVM — provides llvm-lib (MSVC archiver) for the win32 cross-build
brew install llvm
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"

# Now build all 6 platforms (~2 min each; ~12 min total)
yarn build:all
```

**Why zig?** `napi build --cross-compile` uses `cargo-zigbuild` under the hood.
`cargo-zigbuild` requires a `zig` binary on PATH; it does **not** auto-download
one. Without `zig`: `Error: Failed to find zig / cannot find binary path`.

**Why llvm?** The `cc-rs` build script of a C dependency (`pcre2`) needs
`llvm-lib` (LLVM’s MSVC-compatible archiver) when cross-compiling to
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. `brew install llvm` installs it at
`/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-lib`. Without it:
`error occurred in cc-rs: failed to find tool "llvm-lib"`.

CI builds all 6 platforms in a zig-equipped Linux environment and publishes
them before the root package. See `RELEASE_GUIDE.md`.
