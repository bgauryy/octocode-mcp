/**
 * File read-state tracking and per-file mutation queue.
 *
 * Centralises two shared-state concerns that previously lived in edit-tool.ts
 * but are consumed by write-tool.ts and octocode-tools.ts as well:
 *
 *   1. Read-state map — records content hashes so the edit tool can detect
 *      stale reads before writing (a lost-update guard).
 *   2. Per-file mutation queue — serialises concurrent read-modify-write cycles
 *      on the same file path so parallel tool calls cannot race (within this
 *      process only — see the cross-process note below).
 *
 * Keeping these in one place removes the coupling where write-tool and
 * octocode-tools previously imported from edit-tool.
 *
 * SCOPE — this guard is PROCESS-LOCAL. The read-state map and mutation queue only
 * serialise edits issued within *this* Pi process. They do NOT protect against a
 * second process (for example, a parallel agent worker) editing the same file
 * concurrently. Cross-process safety is a separate layer: declare edited paths
 * via Awareness (`work start`) and take an exclusive lease (`lock acquire`) for
 * non-mergeable or risky shared files — the Awareness pre-edit `tool_call` gate
 * (wired at activation) enforces those leases across processes. See
 * docs/AWARENESS_AGENT_FLOW.md §"Hooks during edits".
