# Session Artifacts

Durable files that Octocode writes during a session—plan pages, screenshots,
compaction snapshots, error logs, and more—land in one **session artifact tree**.
Large generic tool results and bash logs are the deliberate exception: they use
private files under `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/tmp/tool-results/` and are deleted
during `session_shutdown` after the bounded result has exposed a chunk-read path.

---

## Where your files live

Durable session outputs are written under:

```
$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/sessions/<session-key>/
```

Extension-private SQLite state for MCP and skill overrides, catalog metadata, and
worker lifecycle records is stored at:

```
$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/state/extension.sqlite3
```

This extension-owned database is separate from shared Awareness coordination and
memory state. Plans, tasks, interactions, and memories continue to use the canonical
Awareness database opened by `openAwarenessStore`, which defaults to
`$OCTOCODE_HOME/awareness/awareness.sqlite3`. An explicit repository scope selects
`<workspace>/.octocode/awareness.sqlite3`. These records stay outside extension-private
storage and are not copied or forked with sessions. Agent-control database settings
do not redirect Awareness storage.
With `storage.mode=memory`, the extension-private SQLite database is not opened; the
filesystem session indexes still work, while `lock`, `message`, and durable `memory`
operations return an actionable disabled-persistence error.

The JSON indexes are inspectable projections, not canonical coordination state. They
never copy message bodies or durable memory rows from Awareness.

The `session-key` is derived from the session ID (from the Pi session manager)
combined with a SHA-256 fingerprint of the session + workspace, so:

- **Different sessions** in the same workspace get different keys.
- **Same session** always resolves to the same directory, even after restart.
- The key format is: `<slug-of-session-id>-<12-char-hex-hash>` (for example, `my-session-a3f4b9c12d01`).
- When Pi has no real session ID, documents use an opaque deterministic `pi-session-*` ID;
  private session-file paths are not copied into the manifest or indexes.

### Session memory contract

`memory.md` is bounded continuity for the current Pi session, not the durable Awareness `memory` tool. Its template has `Gotchas`, `Improvements`, `Findings`, `Decisions`, `Handoff`, and `Reflections` sections. Keep at most 10 one-line entries per section, each no longer than 200 characters; the prompt projection is capped at 4 KB.

When research or a subagent returns a key result, the parent first verifies it, then records a concise session-relevant fact under `Findings`. The next turn compares the bounded current bytes with the last delivered version, so changed or cleared notes are surfaced once without repeating unchanged memory. Successful compaction independently validates and rehydrates the current memory owner. The parent also updates the user when a fact changes the hypothesis, plan, risk, or next action. Routine progress stays out of both channels. Raw handbacks and unverified claims are never copied into `memory.md`.

Plan state writes use V4. Unlike V3, V4 preserves lifecycle and review metadata when no
execution steps exist and records an explicit `cleared` tombstone. V3 snapshots remain
readable. Resume and tree navigation restore the selected branch snapshot; a fork demotes
inherited executing/verifying/blocked work to accepted (or draft), removes shared task
mappings, and requires a new Start and claim in the fork.

---

## The manifest

Every time a file is written, its relative path is recorded in `manifest.json`
at the session root. You can open it any time to see exactly what the current
session has produced:

```json
// $OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/sessions/<session-key>/manifest.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "sessionId": "my-session",
  "sessionKey": "my-session-a3f4b9c12d01",
  "backlogId": "pi-backlog-8f1d2c3b4a59687766554433",
  "identitySource": "session-id",
  "workspace": "/Users/you/myproject",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-24T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-24T11:30:42.000Z",
  "producers": {
    "session-index": {
      "firstSeenAt": "2026-08-24T10:00:00.000Z",
      "lastSeenAt": "2026-08-24T11:30:42.000Z",
      "paths": ["session.json", "plan/index.json", "tasks/index.json", "backlog/index.json"]
    },
    "plan": {
      "firstSeenAt": "2026-08-24T10:01:00.000Z",
      "lastSeenAt": "2026-08-24T11:30:42.000Z",
      "paths": ["plan/plan.html", "plan/plan.md", "plan/state.json"]
    },
    "browser": {
      "firstSeenAt": "2026-08-24T10:05:00.000Z",
      "lastSeenAt": "2026-08-24T10:05:02.000Z",
      "paths": ["browser/screenshots/screenshot-1234567890.png"]
    },
    "log": {
      "paths": ["logs/error.txt"]
    }
  }
}
```

The manifest plus `session.json`, `plan/index.json`, `tasks/index.json`, and
`backlog/index.json` all use the single current session artifact version (`2`). Earlier
versions are rejected rather than upgraded or mixed. Read `session.json` when you need
the explicit `sessionId`, `backlogId`, active `planId`, task IDs, or index paths.

---

## View the plan page

The plan HTML file (`plan/plan.html`) checks for updates every 3 seconds and
reloads only when the generated plan revision changes. You can
open it in a browser directly:

```sh
open "$(ls -dt "$OCTOCODE_HOME"/extension/sessions/*/plan/plan.html | head -1)"
```

Or use the `localServer` tool inside Octocode to serve it:

```
/octocode-plan
```

The plan page renders:
- Current steps with status icons (todo / doing / done)
- The linked RFC document (if any)
- Decision log entries
- A dependency diagram (Mermaid)

---

## Error logs

The error log captures extension-visible problems: tool failures (`isError: true`),
hook exceptions, and provider HTTP errors ≥ 400.

```sh
# Find the current session's error log
ls -t "$OCTOCODE_HOME"/extension/sessions/*/logs/error.txt | head -1 | xargs cat
```

Each entry includes: timestamp, uptime, source, cwd, model, severity, duration
(for tool/provider failures), redacted details, and stack trace for errors.

> **Note:** Secret-like fields (`authorization`, `token`, `cookie`, `secret`,
> `password`, API keys) are **redacted** before writing.

---

## Compaction snapshots

After Pi successfully compacts the conversation context, Octocode writes a
Markdown recovery checkpoint to:

- **Timestamped snapshot:** `compaction/<timestamp>-<label>.md` — never overwritten; one file per compaction event.
- **Latest pointer:** `compaction/latest.md` — always the most recent snapshot.

Checkpoints retain user-visible text, plan state, and safe tool metadata. They never
retain private model reasoning blocks or raw tool-call arguments.

The checkpoint includes a secret-redacted copy of Pi's summary, read and modified file pointers, and the
active plan with its RFC and step paths. It is a recovery hint. Reopen the current
plan and referenced docs before resuming; current sources override stale snapshot
text.

### Compaction and smart-resume flow

1. Pi's native auto-compaction runs after tool results and before the next
   assistant response when its configured reserve threshold is crossed. Configure
   `compaction.reserveTokens` to 20% of the active model context window for an
   80% policy. Pi selects the history boundary and summarizes it. On an
   overflow split turn only, Octocode can supply a bounded deterministic fallback
   that preserves resume instructions, plan and doc pointers, file lists, and
   Pi's split-turn marker.
2. After a successful `session_compact`, Octocode clears stale file-read state,
   writes the checkpoint, stages a digest-bound rehydration ledger, and shows one
   `context compacted — checkpoint ready` card.
   A failed compaction releases the threshold request guard without writing a
   success checkpoint, so a later settled boundary can retry safely.
3. If `willRetry` is true, Pi retries the interrupted agent turn. Octocode does
   not start a competing continuation. Manual and threshold compactions likewise
   do not create an extra turn.
4. Smart resume compares the saved ledger with the live plan and registered
   context owners. It restores only matching, unexpired, explicitly eligible
   segments from
   their current owners; saved bodies never override newer plan or doc state. The
   aggregate projection is capped at 8,000 estimated tokens. Generic tool results,
   prior user requests, and selected skill bodies are not automatically replayed.
   The ledger expires after 24 hours.
5. The prompt resumes only authorized unfinished work. A complete request, an
   approval gate, or a user wait state remains stopped.

Large provider-visible tool results use the same artifact root. Omitted text is
stored under `tool-results/*.txt`; excess images are stored as binary files with
a `tool-results/*-images.json` manifest containing their MIME types, sizes, and
resolved paths.

If ledger staging fails, compaction still succeeds, and the checkpoint card still
appears. Continue from Pi's summary and the current active plan.

---

## Fallback behavior

Every route has a safe fallback for situations where the workspace doesn't yet
exist or the session context is absent (for example, during early startup):

| Producer | Fallback path |
|----------|---------------|
| `plan` | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/tmp/plan/<scope-hash>/` |
| `browser` | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/workspaces/<workspace-key>/` |
| `compaction` | No separate fallback write; the Pi transcript remains authoritative if the artifact write fails |
| `log` | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/workspaces/<workspace-key>/logs/error.txt` |
| `image` | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/tmp/images/<session-id>/` |
| Shell and dynamic-tool spill files | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/tmp/` |
| MCP package cache | `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/cache/mcp-npx/` |

Fallback writes are never registered in the session manifest, so the manifest
reflects only session-scoped artifacts. Extension-owned fallback storage never
leaves `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension/`.

---

## File security

- Directories: created with mode `0700` (owner read/write/execute only).
- Files: written with mode `0600` (owner read/write only).
- All writes use an atomic temp-file + rename pattern — no partial reads.
- Symlink escape is checked at each path boundary (traversal cannot escape the session root).
- The manifest is protected by a `O_EXCL` lock file during every update.

---

## Clean up

Session artifact trees accumulate over time. Each tree is small (a few KB to a
few MB depending on screenshot count). You can safely delete old session trees:

```sh
# List all session trees, sorted by age
ls -lt "$OCTOCODE_HOME"/extension/sessions/

# Remove trees older than 30 days
find "$OCTOCODE_HOME"/extension/sessions -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +30 -print

# After reviewing the printed paths, remove only the exact session directories you selected.
```

> Session artifacts are global and never need a repository `.gitignore` entry.

## Internals (developer reference)

The session artifact system is implemented in:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/tools/session-artifacts.ts` | Core API: `createSessionArtifactContext`, `resolveSessionIdentity`, CAS projection, branch snapshots |
| `src/tools/active-plan.ts` | Exports `artifactContextForScope(scope)` — bridges plan scope → session identity |
| `src/tools/plan-html.ts` | Writes `plan/plan.html` + `plan/plan.md` via the artifact context |
| `src/chrome-debug.ts` | `getSessionDir(cwd, port, sessionKey?)` and `getScreenshotDir(cwd?, sessionKey?)` |
| `src/tools/chrome-debug-tool.ts` | Resolves `sessionKey` from `resolveSessionIdentity` and passes to `connectToChrome` |
| `src/tools/compaction-artifacts.ts` | `writeCompactionArtifact(details, session?, cwd?)` — session path when cwd+session provided |
| `src/tools/compaction-hooks.ts` | Passes `ctx.cwd` to `writeCompactionArtifact` |
| `src/tools/export-command.ts` | Registers `export/latest-ref.json` after writing the branded HTML export |
| `src/tools/create-image-tool.ts` | `persistFallbackPng` — writes to `images/` in the session tree, with an extension temp fallback |
| `src/extension-paths.ts` | Canonical `$OCTOCODE_HOME/extension` root and workspace, temp, and cache projections |
| `src/index.ts` | `getInternalErrorLogPath` returns `logs/error.txt` inside session tree; checkpoint ref registered on engine init |

### Add a new producer

1. Add your producer name to `SessionArtifactProducer` in `session-artifacts.ts`.
2. Import `createSessionArtifactContext` (or `resolveSessionIdentity` for path-only) in your tool.
3. Call `ctx.writeText` / `ctx.writeJson` for the actual content.
4. Call `ctx.registerProducer('your-slot', 'relative/path.ext')` after the write.
5. Provide a fallback write path for when the session context is unavailable.
6. Add a test case to `tests/session-artifact-wiring.test.ts`.
