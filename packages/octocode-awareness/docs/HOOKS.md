# Hooks And Host Integration

Hooks automate Awareness lifecycle edges after the skill/CLI has chosen work; they do
not choose tasks, prove success, or replace `attend`/verify. The CLI works without
them. Claude, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini use the shared hook runner.
OpenCode uses one generated project plugin that only translates host events into that
runner. Pi uses package APIs, native extension events, and the shared coordination
store; it does not install or spawn shell hooks.

Shell hooks remain inert until `<OCTOCODE_HOME>/awareness.json` exists and validates.
Feature behavior follows [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md). Before every real hook
installation, show the dry-run target and obtain separate user approval immediately
before changing host settings; configuration answers do not grant that approval.

Workspace policy selects a hook profile. `guard` keeps matcher-limited mutation
admission plus stop verification. `coordination` registers generic tool boundaries,
validates native payloads, and classifies reads, writes, shells, MCP calls, and unknown
tools before selecting communication or write subscribers. `full` additionally installs
prompt/session briefing, compaction, and session-end capture. The default is `coordination`.

A path-bearing payload is not sufficient evidence of a write. Only classified workspace
writes enter presence, conflict admission, edit receipts, and fallback verification.
Operation-bearing editor tools are classified by operation: `view` is a read, while
known create/replace/insert operations are writes; unknown operations stay unknown.
Generic communication and notification delivery do not settle work. Hook stdout offers
context through the current host/event response channel; it does not prove persistence
or model consumption.

## Lifecycle

| Event | Behavior | Output/blocking |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt/session start (`full`) | Register agent; check a database/WAL change token before querying; detect changed operational state plus at most one prompt-grounded memory lead. | Emit a typed pointer such as `Awareness: memory 1.`; stay silent when stores are unchanged. |
| Generic tool pre/post (`coordination`/`full`) | Validate and classify the native event; inspect bounded changed communication without creating write presence. | Event-specific context offer where supported; unsupported response events remain silent. |
| Before write | Run harness guard, resolve task/explicit work, declare advisory path; honor exclusivity. | Silent normally; typed overlap pointer; host-native denial on guard or exclusive conflict. |
| Successful write | Write edit audit and heartbeat; keep a scoped automatic HOOK active. | Best-effort, nonblocking. |
| Failed write | Discard hook-created path presence that has no successful edit audit. | No edit audit or verification debt for a change that never happened. |
| Subagent start | Register the host child identity and deliver changed state where the host supports child-context injection. | Cursor registration is useful, but child-context injection remains version/surface-dependent. |
| Stop/subagent stop | Finalize the scoped HOOK once, then audit verification debt. | Count-only block or reminder; inspect details explicitly. |
| Pre/PostCompact (`full`) | Finalize scoped HOOK state and capture a deduplicated handoff; keep the session reusable. | Best-effort, nonblocking. |
| SessionEnd (`full`) | Finalize/capture, then mark the host session ended without claiming work success. | Best-effort, nonblocking. |

Pre-edit is the single guard+presence hook. The old separate harness-guard install
entry is removed during install/repair to guarantee guard ordering.

## Host Support

| Host | Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Skill frontmatter while active, or `.claude/settings.json` | Installed hooks add SessionStart; both cover success/failure writes, subagent start/stop, compact lifecycle, SessionEnd, prompt and notification briefing. Choose one surface. |
| Codex | `.codex/hooks.json` | SessionStart/SessionEnd, success writes, subagent start/stop, PreCompact, prompt/stop. No distinct failure event; PostToolUse failure metadata is handled when present. |
| Cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` | Success/failure writes plus session/subagent/compact/end edges. Cloud supports write/subagent/prompt/compact/stop hooks but not `sessionStart`/`sessionEnd`; child-context injection is not assumed. |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/hooks/octocode-awareness.json` | Project-scoped official v1 hook file; success/failure writes, session/subagent/compact/end, prompt, and stop events. Global install is unsupported. |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` | Session, tool, agent, compression, and end events using Gemini event names and timeout units. |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/plugins/octocode-awareness.js` | Project-scoped auto-discovered plugin; tool hooks can deny writes, while session events remain fail-open. No OpenCode settings file is rewritten. |
| Pi | `@octocodeai/pi-extension` native events | `tool_call` guard/presence plus `tool_execution_end` success audit/release, session registry join/leave, durable event delivery, and compaction rehydration. No shell-hook install. |
| Custom | Library API or `hook run` payload | Must provide stable identity/path events. |

## Install And Verify

Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, and OpenCode require project config. When Claude skill frontmatter is active, use it
and do not also install project settings; `hooks check` reports that definition as a
separate surface without pretending activation was observed.
Preview writes, install after approval, then check exact host config:

```bash
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness hooks install --host <codex|copilot|cursor|gemini|opencode> \
  --profile coordination --project-dir . --dry-run
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness hooks install --host <codex|copilot|cursor|gemini|opencode> \
  --profile coordination --project-dir . --compact
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness hooks check --host <codex|copilot|cursor|gemini|opencode> \
  --project-dir . --strict --compact
```

Use `--host claude` only when skill frontmatter is unsupported or disabled.

Remove (preview first) when uninstalling host wiring:

```bash
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness hooks remove --host <claude|codex|copilot|cursor|gemini|opencode> \
  --project-dir . --dry-run
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness hooks remove --host <claude|codex|copilot|cursor|gemini|opencode> \
  --project-dir . --compact
```

Installers modify only recognizable Awareness-owned entries, including obsolete roots
or event placements, while preserving unrelated hooks. Project hooks call the canonical
`hook-runner.mjs` directly; generated `out/` is only a fallback when no project skill
exists. Commands are quoted and Codex gets a Windows command. Strict health verifies
the runner target; a missing target is drift.

`hooks check --strict` remains definition/config-scoped. Runtime receipts are one bounded
SQLite upsert per workspace, host, and event—no payloads or append-only hook logs. Read:

- `surface`: settings, project plugin, or Claude skill frontmatter;
- `health.config` / `health.definition`: whether the selected surface is exact;
- `health.activation`: still unverified when a host cannot expose it;
- `health.runtime`: `unverified`, `observed`, `stale` after seven days, or `failed`;
- `health.coverage` and `last_seen`: which expected events have actually executed;
- Codex runtime notes: project trust, hook-definition trust, and feature enablement
  are not discoverable from the config file alone;
- Cursor runtime notes: local/cloud and model-context delivery require separate
  smoke checks; flat hook config has no guaranteed Windows command override.

After installation, edit a harmless file and confirm:

1. `work list` shows the active task/explicit presence, or fallback enters Verify.
2. Two ordinary agents can share a file and receive one changed-peer summary.
3. An explicit exclusive run blocks the second agent before presence.
4. `verify audit` clears only after the declared check and `verify mark`.
5. A write after PreCompact reuses the session; SessionEnd leaves later conflicts
   with `holder_session_active:false` rather than claiming success.

Config-ready does not mean runtime-ready. Confirm where the host sends stdout/stderr,
that the exact hook runs, and that model-visible context or continuation arrives.

## Identity And Run Resolution

Identity order: host payload agent, `OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID`, then payload session.
Payload agent and session IDs also accept nested tool-input fields. A missing stable
identity is rejected before agent registration or work presence; names, vendors,
hosts, and workspace paths do not supply a fallback identity. A host child ID
prevents subagents collapsing into their parent. Reuse one stable environment ID
for each session so its CLI and hook work agree, and give every child a distinct ID.

Pre-edit resolves the run in this order:

1. exactly one live task claim for the agent/workspace;
2. an explicit active WORK run already declaring the target path;
3. the active fallback HOOK for the same agent, stable session/transcript,
   workspace, and artifact; otherwise a new fallback.

Post-edit keeps that fallback active and attaches further files. Stop/agent-end or
PreCompact finalizes it once to PENDING, so N edits produce one item with N files.
TASK and explicit WORK are never merged. Without stable session/transcript identity,
post-edit uses the isolated per-event lifecycle rather than guessing across sessions.
Shell get-or-create is cross-process locked. PreCompact keeps the session reusable;
SessionEnd safely finalizes any remaining aggregate and marks the session ended.

Fallback verification plans name up to three files plus an omitted count and require
the smallest relevant test/typecheck, diff inspection, and a recorded result. Recursive
Stop audits again only when continuation edits finalize new debt, avoiding silent loss
without looping forever on unchanged debt.

## Guard

The configured runner receives `--skill-root`; Claude frontmatter wrappers export the
equivalent value. The guard runs before touching `run_files`.

Protected harness/skill edits require:

- explicit user authorization;
- `OCTOCODE_ALLOW_HARNESS_APPLY=1`;
- a non-main branch;
- `OCTOCODE_HARNESS_BRANCH_OK=1` only for explicitly approved detached/non-repo cases.

A denied guard leaves no false file presence.

## Briefing And Peer Dedupe

`delivery_state` stores content fingerprints per consumer/channel/scope. Unchanged
briefings and peer sets emit nothing. This does not acknowledge signals; `signal ack`
remains explicit.

For Claude and Codex prompt hooks, the current prompt is held only as a bounded
transient query; it is not written to SQLite. The selector searches the
existing scoped memory bank, requires at least two meaningful prompt/memory token
matches across the bounded normal recall pool, selects at most one memory lead, and
otherwise stays silent. A match changes the fingerprint but does not embed the lead.
Signals, overrides, recurring-failure pressure, and open-refinement counts remain
separate operational interventions. This is a deterministic local policy, not a
second reasoning agent, and it never makes recalled text authoritative.

The selector still bounds and fingerprints at most five items, but the hook emits only
`Awareness state changed.`. Memory observations, handoff bodies, maintenance commands,
and other ledger contents require a targeted `attend`, signal, or memory read.

Claude/Codex emit event-named `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. Cursor emits
native `additional_context` at session start and `agent_message` around tool use;
delivery is best-effort and must be smoked. Changed overlap emits only the affected
path summary; peer identities, rationales, and ownership require an explicit read.

## Failure Behavior

- Real exclusive conflict and harness denial use exit 2 on shell/OpenCode adapters;
  Cursor emits `permission: deny`, Copilot emits a deny decision, and Gemini emits a
  blocking host response.
- Stop debt uses exit 2 where supported and host-native continuation/follow-up output elsewhere.
- Infrastructure, extraction, post-edit, briefing, and session failures warn and fail
  open so the editor remains usable.
- A failed write rolls back hook-created file presence without an edit audit; TASK or
  explicit WORK ownership is preserved because the user may retry or investigate.
- A missing correlation never marks success; TTL and verification audit expose debt.

Environment controls read by every shared hook-runner adapter:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID` | Stable cooperative identity. |
| `OCTOCODE_AGENT_NAME` | Optional display name attached to registered agent identity. |
| `OCTOCODE_ARTIFACT` (aliases `OCTOCODE_PACKAGE`, `OCTOCODE_SERVICE`) | Scope presence/coordination to one artifact inside a monorepo workspace. |
| `OCTOCODE_HOME` | Root for the default global Awareness store and global hook change fingerprints; repository scope remains available explicitly. |
| `OCTOCODE_NO_VERIFY_GATE=1` | Disable stop gate only with replacement process. |
| `OCTOCODE_NO_NOTIFY=1` | Disable prompt briefing. |
| `OCTOCODE_NO_SESSION_CAPTURE=1` | Disable automatic handoff capture. |
| `OCTOCODE_NOTIFY_RUN_DIGEST=1` | Opt in to a scoped, deduped prompt-time maintenance preview; never applies cleanup. |
| `OCTOCODE_NO_DIGEST=1` | Force-disable the digest preview even when `OCTOCODE_NOTIFY_RUN_DIGEST=1` is set. |
| `OCTOCODE_DIGEST_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Minimum hours between digest previews (default 4). |
| `OCTOCODE_ALLOW_HARNESS_APPLY=1` | Open harness edit gate; branch rule still applies. |
| `OCTOCODE_SKILL_ROOT` | Skill root the pre-edit guard checks edits against; exported by the shell wrapper. Guard is a no-op when unset. |
| `OCTOCODE_HARNESS_BRANCH_OK=1` | Acknowledge a detached/non-repo skill root when the branch cannot be confirmed. |

Invocation plumbing, not ordinary agent configuration: project hooks pass `--host`
and invoke the resolved Node executable directly. Claude skill wrappers instead accept
`OCTOCODE_NODE_BIN` when the host environment must override `node`; host payloads or
the runner's Claude default identify that surface.

Cross-host adapters, installer repair, peer dedupe, guard order, and
verification caps are covered by focused tests.
