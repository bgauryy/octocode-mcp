# Awareness database

Awareness owns coordination state in an Awareness-only SQLite database. The
default is `$OCTOCODE_HOME/awareness/awareness.sqlite3`; an explicit workspace
policy or `--db-scope repo` selects `<workspace>/.octocode/awareness.sqlite3`,
while `--db` has highest precedence. [STORAGE_SCOPES.md](STORAGE_SCOPES.md) defines placement,
overrides and artifacts.

The normal Awareness store opener never opens
`$OCTOCODE_HOME/agent/agent.sqlite3` or
`$OCTOCODE_HOME/agent/core.sqlite3`. Those files belong to the Agent. The
Awareness runtime rejects mixed `agent.sqlite3` files. A database owned by the Octocode CLI, an MCP server, or another
`.octocode/` consumer is also outside this package's authority.

## Entity ownership

Awareness owns collaboration entities such as:

- plans, plan membership, tasks, dependencies, claims, and task runs;
- advisory file work, exclusive locks, and verification receipts;
- agents, messages, delivery state, signals, and coordination handoffs;
- memories and references, refinements, reflection, and maintenance records;
- Awareness hook receipts, Awareness-specific session captures, and the
  redacted `worker_lifecycle_events` coordination projection.

These records describe coordination. The worker projection is not the Agent's
authoritative worker mailbox, worktree/handoff ledger, process state, or
dependency ledger. Agent runtime sessions, effects, lifecycle records,
automation leases, and fencing state belong in
`$OCTOCODE_HOME/agent/core.sqlite3`; Agent control/index data belongs in
`$OCTOCODE_HOME/agent/agent.sqlite3`.

Don't copy table totals into prose. The executable relation contract changes as
entities evolve:

- `src/db-schema.ts` owns the canonical tables, indexes, and optional FTS.
- `src/db-continuity-schema.ts` defines the unique delivery and interaction tables.
- `src/db-introspection.ts` derives the expected relation set and schema
  fingerprint.
- `tests/database-shared-contract.test.ts` and
  `tests/database-advanced-contract.test.ts` assert the executable schema.

Use `schema commands --compact`, `schema entities --compact`, and
`schema json-schema <name>` for public CLI and entity contracts. Pass `--all` to
`schema entities` for owner and relation kind. Treat those schemas and the
executable DDL as authoritative when this page and implementation diverge.

## Query ownership

For primary keys, foreign keys, logical references, and host-owned identifiers,
see [entity identities and connections](ENTITY_LINKS.md).

`AWARENESS_QUERY_VIEWS` in `src/repo-model.ts` enumerates live views.
`src/repo-query.ts` dispatches them to focused row builders:

| Views | Owner |
|---|---|
| `repo-profile`, `files`, `activity` | `src/repo-files.ts` |
| `memories`, `gotchas`, `lessons`, `plans`, `tasks`, `runs` | `src/repo-plans.ts` |
| `locks`, `agents`, `signals`, `refinements`, `developer-review` | `src/repo-coordination.ts` |
| `workboard` | `src/repo-workboard.ts` |
| `all` | `src/repo-query.ts` bounded fan-out |

Formatting lives in `src/repo-formats.ts`, scoping in `src/repo-scope.ts`, and
explicit export writes in `src/repo-projection.ts`. Query exports are read-only
snapshots; Awareness never reads them back as canonical state.

## Fail-closed database identity

Agent and Awareness databases have distinct application identities and expected
relation sets. An Awareness open accepts an empty database or a recognized
Awareness database. It rejects:

| Store | `PRAGMA application_id` | ASCII |
|---|---:|---|
| Agent control/index | `0x4f435441` | `OCTA` |
| Agent Rust runtime | `0x4f434147` | `OCAG` |
| Awareness coordination | `0x4f435431` | `OCT1` |

- an Agent control or Agent runtime identity;
- a CLI, MCP, or other foreign application identity;
- an identity-free database with unrecognized relations;
- a drifted Awareness schema with unknown or incompatible relations; and
- unexpected application tables, views, indexes, or triggers.

Recognized historical Awareness databases require explicit conversion into a new
destination; normal opens never upgrade them. Identity validation happens before schema writes. Initialization
assigns the Awareness identity only after DDL, indexes, optional FTS,
fingerprint, integrity, and foreign-key checks succeed. It must never relabel a
populated database to make it appear compatible.

Fresh initialization runs under a write transaction so concurrent first opens
serialize. A waiting process reclassifies the database after acquiring the lock;
it doesn't assume the file is still empty.

## SQLite runtime safety

The embedded SQLite version controls journal selection. Runtime builds known to
be safe can use WAL for concurrent readers and writers; other builds use rollback
journaling. Both paths use a bounded busy timeout and retry deadline.

Every returned connection enables foreign keys. Initialization and canonical
opens enforce:

- the complete expected Awareness relation set;
- no Agent-owned or otherwise unexpected application relations;
- normalized DDL and schema-fingerprint equality;
- `PRAGMA integrity_check`; and
- `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`.

FTS5 is optional because the embedded SQLite build can omit it. When present,
the executable DDL and introspection modules own its virtual table and generated
shadow-table treatment.

## Operational checks

Use the Awareness CLI and package tests rather than editing a database manually:

```bash
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness maintenance init --workspace "$PWD" --compact
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness status --workspace "$PWD" --compact
yarn workspace @octocodeai/octocode-awareness test
yarn workspace @octocodeai/octocode-awareness test:smoke
yarn workspace @octocodeai/octocode-awareness lint
```

For an explicit file, use an Awareness-specific name:

```bash
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness maintenance init --db /absolute/path/awareness.sqlite3 --compact
```

An old mixed Agent/Awareness database is unsupported. Preserve it for inspection
and select a fresh Awareness store; do not point an Awareness opener at the mixed
source. See [storage admission and scope](STORAGE_SCOPES.md).

If identity or fingerprint validation rejects a store, preserve it for
inspection. Don't rerun initialization against an Agent, CLI, MCP, unknown, or
mixed database, and don't change `PRAGMA application_id` manually. Follow the
store-selection guidance in [STORAGE_SCOPES.md](STORAGE_SCOPES.md).

## Explicit consolidation copy

Use consolidation only to copy an exact current canonical Awareness ledger into a
**new** file. It opens the source read-only, writes a private
temporary file beside the requested destination, validates it, then publishes
the finished file atomically. It never upgrades, relabels, or deletes the
source. The destination must not already exist.

```bash
npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness database consolidate \
  --source /absolute/path/current-awareness.sqlite3 \
  --destination /absolute/path/awareness-consolidated.sqlite3 \
  --dry-run \
  --compact
```

`--dry-run` validates a private temporary copy, then discards it. Inspect the
reported counts, then omit `--dry-run` to publish the new destination. Any older,
incomplete, mixed, or drifted schema is rejected. Copying retains transport sequence high-water marks,
including positions whose events were already pruned, so consumer cursors stay valid.

The command prints JSON. A safe refusal has `ok: false` and does not publish a
destination. Unsupported stores are not migrated; select a fresh Awareness store.

The programmatic API is
`consolidateDatabase(sourcePath, destinationPath, { dryRun })`.
On success it reports copied-table counts. On failure it
leaves the source unchanged and does not publish a destination.
