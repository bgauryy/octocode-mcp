# Comprehensive Awareness audit

This page defines the repeatable audit rubric. The
[Awareness guide](../README.md#verification-and-known-limits) owns the overview and
known limits. Keep dated results with their benchmark receipts; partial host
evidence does not establish a comprehensive PASS.

Use this scored lane to answer whether the complete Awareness control loop works.
Run in a disposable workspace/database. Complete the Installed and applicable Host
lanes in [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md), then run the isolated setup and commands in
[FEATURE_SWEEP.md](FEATURE_SWEEP.md). A `BLOCKED` row names its prerequisite and
next action; its command is included only when safe and available. Pipe `< /dev/null` into every call and set env
vars inline per command — an open stdin hangs instead of failing, and a dropped
`export` silently reads the wrong store.

| Area | Evidence | Score 4–5 requires |
|---|---|---|
| Store and schema | self-test; fresh initialization; schema tests; rejected foreign/drifted store | branded, integrity/FK/fingerprint checks pass; incompatibility fails closed |
| Reads | compact attend/status; targeted work/verify/signal/memory reads | bounded next action, explicit omissions, deliberate deep drill-down |
| Work | two-agent same-file start/list/show/heartbeat/end | peers coexist and ending one run preserves the other |
| Locks | conflicting acquire/wait/release; stale dry-run prune | conflict exits 2 before unsafe presence; cleanup never means success |
| Tasks and verify | dependency block/unblock; submit/mark/audit for parent and every owned worker | predecessor stays blocked until verified; zero owned final debt; unrelated peer debt preserved and disclosed |
| Communication | register; signal publish/list/reply/ack/resolve; refinement lifecycle | recipient/thread/unread ownership holds; unrelated work is preserved |
| Memory and reflection | record/recall/supersede/archive/restore; reflect record | scoped/ranked SQLite truth; immutable replacement history; current evidence wins |
| Query exports | `query --format csv/html/json` export; live-DB read vs export content comparison | export reflects live SQLite; no stale state injected; `wiki sync` projection feature was removed |
| Hooks | strict check; harmless observed host event; lifecycle edge | config ready and runtime observed; guard/presence/audit/finalize parity |
| Skill | docs list/show; bundled-skill inspection; skill review | live-state routing, manual fallback, no secret handling, focused owners |
| Token delivery | compact tests; unchanged repeat; changed signal/peer/memory lead | stable state silent; one bounded decision packet; full details queryable |
| Maintenance | digest; stale previews; final audit | sensors do not delete live work; reviewed cleanup; no locks/debt |

## Scoring

| Score | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 5 | Normal and adverse behavior passed with repeatable, bounded evidence. |
| 4 | Contract passed; only a minor usability/observability gap remains. |
| 3 | Happy path passed, but an edge/recovery/trust proof is missing. |
| 2 | Important lifecycle or control boundary is unproven or failed. |
| 1 | Surface starts, but its claimed coordination contract is not demonstrated. |
| 0 | Behavior fails, is unsafe, contradicts canonical state, or lacks usable evidence. |
| BLOCKED | A named required prerequisite is unavailable. |

Do not average away safety or authority failures. **PASS** requires every applicable
row at 4–5, a mean of at least 4.5, no blocked rows, and zero final debt/active
locks. **PARTIAL** requires every safety/authority row (store/schema, locks,
verification, query-export correctness, and applicable hooks) at least 4 but misses the
overall score threshold. **FAIL** is any safety/authority row at 0–3, a failed
required behavior, or final debt/active locks. **BLOCKED** prevents a comprehensive
verdict.

For token cost, compare bytes of the initial compact JSON read with the unchanged
repeat. Require a bounded initial decision packet, no repeated unchanged delivery,
truncation metadata where needed, and targeted full-row retrieval. The tested
`attend --compact` contract is 2 KiB; do not replace it with a row-count proxy.

## September 2026 repair evidence

The strongest defects were in ownership and recovery. A valid ID did not imply a
valid connection: a different workspace could clear a handoff or forget memory,
expired claims could renew or complete, and concurrent claimants could overwrite
ownership. Communication also accepted conflicting event retries and permitted
pruning ancestors still needed by replies. These were correctness failures.

| Repaired boundary | Repeatable evidence |
|---|---|
| Attempt-scoped check fences, terminal transitions, force-close cleanup, immutable started contracts, uncapped readiness count | [Task lifecycle regressions](../tests/coordination/task-transitions.test.ts) |
| Workspace links, missing dependencies, graph cycles | [Coordination entity regressions](../tests/coordination/entity-connections.test.ts) |
| Exact lease expiry, invalid waits, cancelled work | [Coordination entity regressions](../tests/coordination/entity-connections.test.ts) |
| Competing processes and one durable owner | [Lock and task process races](../tests/coordination/lock-process-concurrency.test.ts) |
| Reply scope, scoped acknowledgements, retained ancestry | [Signal entity regressions](../tests/entity-connections.test.ts) |
| Conflicting event IDs, private-message receipts, recurring projection changes | [Coordination entity regressions](../tests/coordination/entity-connections.test.ts) |
| Ordered consumer cursors and restart continuity | [Continuity store tests](../tests/coordination/continuity-store.test.ts) |
| Measured state, explicit unknowns, scoped advice | [Physiology tests](../tests/attend-physiology.test.ts) and [ownership tests](../tests/attend-ownership.test.ts) |

Removed: the mixed-store migration command, constructor backfills, schema-guessing
plan/task/memory writes, the internal coordination barrel, the SQLite version
shim, and redundant receipt-deletion SQL. Published package exports still define
the supported library boundary; canonical path equivalence still handles symlinks.

The implementation does not establish complete Agent Physiology. Context/budget
sensing, measured cognitive yield, forecasts, and autonomous worker regulation
remain host responsibilities. Installed-host hook behavior needs evidence from
that host; package tests alone do not establish a comprehensive PASS. Existing
incompatible stores remain preserved and rejected, never silently rewritten.
