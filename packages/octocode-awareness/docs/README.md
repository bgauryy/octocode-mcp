# Octocode Awareness documentation

Each concept has one owner. This index routes the complete bootstrap, operating, state, hook, memory, projection, and exit lifecycle. Command names and schemas come from
`npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness schema commands --compact`; prose docs do not duplicate the
complete command inventory.

Agent-facing procedures live under package-local `skills/octocode-awareness/references/` and
are listed by `npx @octocodeai/octocode-awareness docs list --compact`. Start with `flow-matrix`
when choosing among lifecycle paths, then open exactly one deeper reference.

Canonical Awareness data lives in `$OCTOCODE_HOME/awareness/awareness.sqlite3` by
default. An explicit workspace policy or `--db-scope repo` selects
`<workspace>/.octocode/awareness.sqlite3`; `--db-scope global` selects the global
store for one call, and an explicit `--db` path has highest precedence. Agent
databases under `$OCTOCODE_HOME/agent/` have a separate owner and identity.
On request, `query` writes read-only `<workspace>/.octocode/` export snapshots;
managed `.octocode/plan/**` files are plan narrative, not a live task checklist.
