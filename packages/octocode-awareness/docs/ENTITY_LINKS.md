# Entity identities and connections

Use this reference when tracing a record by ID. Discover the live inventory with
`schema entities --all --compact`. Entity names and constraints come from
[canonical DDL](../src/db-schema.ts), [continuity DDL](../src/db-continuity-schema.ts),
and the [worker projection](../src/worker-lifecycle-ledger.ts).

IDs are opaque handles. Canonical writers generate prefixed UUIDs; continuity and host IDs follow their owning contracts. Do not infer ownership from a prefix. Root commands and host APIs resolve the same records and relationships.

## Canonical ledger

Arrows in the foreign-key column are SQLite constraints. Composite keys are
shown in parentheses. A dash means no declared foreign key.

| Relation | Primary key | Foreign-key targets | Other connections |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessions` | `session_id` | — | Opaque `agent_id`; workspace and artifact scope. |
| `awareness_agents` | (`workspace_path`, `agent_id`) | — | Workspace-scoped identity registry; actors need not have a registry row. |
| `awareness_plans` | `plan_id` | — | `lead_agent_id` is an actor handle; workspace/source keys fence idempotent graph imports. |
| `plan_members` | (`plan_id`, `agent_id`) | `plan_id` → `awareness_plans` | Membership joins actor identity to a plan. |
| `plan_docs` | (`plan_id`, `relative_path`) | `plan_id` → `awareness_plans` | Workspace-relative document path. |
| `awareness_tasks` | `task_id` | `plan_id` → `awareness_plans` | Workspace comes from the plan. |
| `task_paths` | (`task_id`, `path`) | `task_id` → `awareness_tasks` | Planned file scope. |
| `task_dependencies` | (`task_id`, `depends_on_task_id`) | Both IDs → `awareness_tasks` | Same-plan and acyclic graph checks belong to the task API. |
| `task_runs` | `run_id` | `task_id` → `awareness_tasks`; `session_id` → `sessions` | WORK and HOOK runs can have no task; session can be absent. |
| `run_files` | (`run_id`, `file_path`) | `run_id` → `task_runs` | Advisory work presence. |
| `task_claims` | `task_id` | `task_id` → `awareness_tasks`; unique `run_id` → `task_runs` | The claim's task and actor must agree with its run. |
| `task_events` | `event_id` | `task_id` → `awareness_tasks`; `run_id` → `task_runs` | A linked run must concern the event's task. |
| `awareness_locks` | `lock_id` | `run_id` → `task_runs` | File/run pair is unique; exclusive work protection. |
| `run_log` | `event_id` | `run_id` → `task_runs` | Actor and event metadata. |
| `awareness_memories` | `memory_id` | — | `superseded_by` is a historical replacement ID. |
| `memory_refs` | (`memory_id`, `reference`) | `memory_id` → `awareness_memories` | Reference text can identify files, commits, URLs, or external evidence. |
| `memories_fts` | No primary key | — | Search projection keyed logically by `awareness_memories.memory_id`; optional FTS shadow tables are internal. |
| `refinements` | `refinement_id` | — | Actor, workspace, artifact, and file references. |
| `signals` | `signal_id` | — | `reply_to` points to a parent; `thread_id` identifies its root. The signal API owns these links. |
| `signal_reads` | (`signal_id`, `agent_id`) | `signal_id` → `signals` | Actor-specific acknowledgement. |
| `delivery_state` | (`consumer_id`, `channel`, `scope_key`) | — | Consumer delivery fingerprint, not an event foreign key. |
| `hook_receipts` | (`workspace_path`, `host`, `event`) | — | Latest hook execution observation. |
| `edit_log` | `edit_id` | `session_id` → `sessions`; `run_id` → `task_runs` | Audit context includes actor, workspace, and file. |
| `harness_log` | `harness_id` | `session_id` → `sessions`; `memory_id` → `awareness_memories`; `run_id` → `task_runs` | Audit context and event-specific payload. |

## Continuity and host audit

These are delivery, interaction, and audit records, not additional work lifecycles.

| Relation | Primary key | Foreign-key targets | Other connections |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handoffs` | `handoff_id` | — | Actor, workspace, and file references. |
| `event_outbox` | `sequence` | — | Unique `event_id`; aggregate kind/ID, session, and correlation identify external or local subjects. |
| `event_consumers` | (`workspace_path`, `consumer_id`) | — | Sequence is a cursor, not a foreign key; pruning can remove earlier events. |
| `event_acknowledgements` | (`event_id`, `consumer_id`) | `event_id` → `event_outbox` | Consumer handles are workspace-scoped by the API. |
| `pending_interactions` | `interaction_id` | — | Unique `correlation_id`; host session and structured request/answer. |
| `authorization_receipts` | `receipt_id` | — | API checks the answered interaction and session; plan/revision/scope bind authorization rather than implying a local plan FK. |
| `capability_receipts` | `receipt_id` | — | Structured capability decision with host provenance. |
| `worker_lifecycle_events` | `sequence` | — | Unique `packet_id`; host-owned worker/session/correlation handles, indexed together with workspace. |

## Lease and completion fencing

Claims, run files, and exclusive locks carry expiry. Reads project expired state without deleting it. Reclaiming work creates a new run; heartbeat, release, submit, and verification must target the owned run. Host check receipts also bind the pending run's update timestamp. Expiry never proves success. A retry cannot reuse an old completion receipt.

Signals own peer threads and read receipts. Their outbox event is inserted atomically with the signal. Each consumer acknowledges the next event in sequence with `accept`, `hold`, or `refuse`; an acknowledgement with a different decision cannot overwrite an existing one. Cursors describe transport progress and fence pruning at the slowest consumer. They do not replace participant read acknowledgements: accepted peer messages are marked read for the receiving agent after successful host delivery, while held proposals remain unread.

## What an integrity check proves

`PRAGMA foreign_key_check` detects missing targets for declared constraints. It
does not validate workspace equality, actor ownership, dependency graphs,
historical replacement IDs, JSON references, or host-owned IDs. Test those
through the owning APIs, including mismatched IDs from another workspace.

Deleting a memory can leave its ID in older `superseded_by` history. Treat an
unresolved replacement as a retained historical reference. Clearing it blindly
makes replaced memories look like archived memories eligible for restore.
Audit writers likewise retain caller-supplied context; foreign keys establish
target existence, not agreement between every actor, session, run, and workspace.

See [database identity and storage checks](DB.md) before opening an existing
store. Never repair an ID by guessing from a prefix or rewriting live rows.
