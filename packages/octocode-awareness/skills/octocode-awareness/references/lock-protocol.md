# Exclusive Lock And Verification Protocol

Load when overlap is unsafe or non-mergeable and may require exclusivity. This reference step ends here; return to the main skill flow.

Read `plan-task-workflow.md` first. Ordinary writes use advisory work, not locks.

## Exclusive

Use `work start --exclusive` or task/run-aware `lock acquire` only when concurrent editing would be unsafe: migrations, generated singletons, broad rewrites, lockfiles, or other non-mergeable/sensitive paths. Locks are exclusive-only; normal source/doc edits start as advisory WORK and coordinate on overlap.

```bash
# exact acquire (flag is --target-file, not --file); --wait-seconds blocks in-acquire
<cli> lock acquire --agent-id "$OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID" --target-file <path> [--run-id <claimed-run>] --rationale "<why>" [--ttl-minutes <n>] [--wait-seconds <n>] --compact
<cli> lock release --run-id <run> --agent-id "$OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID" --compact   # release without ending the run
```

- Existing other presence → acquisition exits 2; coordinate/wait.
- Existing exclusive → advisory start exits 2 before presence.
- Same run → acquire/renew allowed.
- TTL → crash recovery only, never success. Expired claims must be reacquired, never renewed.
- Host coordination leases cap at 3600 seconds; waits cap at 60 seconds with monotonic elapsed time. Invalid durations fail before acquisition.

## Wait Vs Presence

`lock wait` observes **other agents' lock rows only**. It does **not** mean peers are gone: advisory `run_files` presence can still block exclusive acquire (`ACTIVE_WORK`).
After wait returns clear, re-check `work show --workspace "$PWD" --file <path>` before acquire. Expiry cleans coordination state; it never proves completion. `verify audit` lists `stale_active` when a run is ACTIVE with no live presence.

`lock prune --expired-only --dry-run` previews abandoned protection cleanup. Do not steal live exclusivity.

## Close And Verify

Explicit WORK:

```bash
# run declared check
<cli> work end --run-id <run> --agent-id "$OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID" --compact
<cli> verify mark --run-id <run> --agent-id "$OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID" --status SUCCESS --message "<observed command and passing result>" --compact
```

TASK work uses `task submit`/`task release`; terminal `work end` is rejected. Successful `verify mark` closes the run and linked task. Failure closes them as failed.

Post-edit logs/heartbeats and keeps the scoped HOOK aggregate ACTIVE. Stop, PreCompact, or SessionEnd finalizes it once to PENDING. PreCompact keeps the session reusable; SessionEnd marks it ended. Stop output caps debt; a host may remind instead of block. `verify audit` lists debt (exit **1** when debt remains).
If deliberately using `verify mark --all-pending`, scope it by workspace.
For proven abandonment, mark the exact run `FAILED`; `verify audit` remains read-only.

Presence/lock expiry never moves a live TASK run to PENDING. Task claim expiry is a separate atomic lifecycle that fails its attempt and returns the task to OPEN.

Use `--status FAILED` for an observed failed check; leave unrun checks pending. Before finishing, run `verify audit --agent-id "$OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID" --workspace "$PWD"` in the same store and settle or disclose your remaining debt.

Return to `SKILL.md`. Exit codes: **2** = lock conflict or wait timeout; **1** = verify debt / validation.
