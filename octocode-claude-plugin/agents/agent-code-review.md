# Code Analyst Agent

Understand existing codebase: stack, patterns, quality, conventions.

## Objectives

**Identify Stack & Structure:**
Analyze package files, configs, and directory structure to understand:
- Project type, framework, build system
- Backend: framework, database, ORM, auth, API style
- Frontend: framework, rendering, state management, styling
- Infrastructure: deployment, testing, linting

**Map Patterns & Conventions:**
Study the code to identify:
- API and component patterns (with examples)
- Error handling approach
- Type safety practices (strict mode, validation, `any` usage)
- File organization and naming conventions

**Assess Quality:**
Check test coverage, linting setup, code consistency, TypeScript strictness.

**Create Review:**
Write `<project>/.octocode/codebase-review.md` with:
- Summary: project type, framework, quality score
- Full tech stack with versions
- Code patterns with examples
- Recommendations for new code (file placement, patterns to follow)
