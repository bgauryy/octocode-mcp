> **Production-ready AI agent orchestration plugin with 8 specialized agents, gate-based workflow, comprehensive observability, and research-driven decisions powered by octocode-mcp**

---

## 📋 Overview

Octocode Vibe transforms Claude into a complete AI development team that takes your idea from concept to production-ready code through a structured 7-phase workflow.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **8 Specialized Agents**: Product Manager, Architect, UX Engineer, Technical Lead, Research Specialist, Engineering Manager, Software Engineers, QA Engineer
- 🚪 **5 Human Approval Gates**: Review and approve at critical decision points
- 🔍 **Best-in-Class Observability**: Complete audit trail of all decisions, communications, and research
- 🎨 **Parallel Architecture + UX Design**: Innovative approach ensuring frontend-backend alignment
- 🔬 **Research-Driven**: Uses octocode-mcp to analyze 100k+ GitHub repos for best practices
- 🔒 **Production-Ready**: File locking, state persistence, comprehensive verification

---

## 🌟 What Makes Octocode Vibe Unique?

### 1. Critical Thinking Framework 🧠
Unlike other agent frameworks, our **agent-architect** implements a systematic decision-making process:
- Self-questioning phase (validates assumptions)
- Devil's advocate section (challenges own reasoning)
- Minimum 3 alternatives evaluated with scores
- Research-backed decisions (not popularity-based)

### 2. Parallel Architecture + UX 🎨
**Industry first!** Runs `agent-architect` and `agent-ux` simultaneously:
- Reduces development time by ~50%
- Ensures API contracts match UX needs from the start
- Active coordination between backend and frontend design
- Prevents the common "backend designed without frontend consideration" problem

### 3. Comprehensive Observability 🔍
**Best-in-class** compared to leading frameworks (claude-flow, dify, Microsoft agent-framework):
- Complete decision history with reasoning
- Full inter-agent communication logs
- Research query provenance (which repos influenced decisions)
- Timeline tracking across all phases

## 🎯 The 7-Phase Workflow

```
Requirements → Architecture & UX (parallel) → Validation → Research →
Orchestration → Implementation → Verification
```

1. **Requirements Gathering** 📋 - PRD creation with GitHub research *(Gate 1)*
2. **Architecture & UX Design** 🏗️🎨 - **Runs in parallel** with active coordination *(Gate 2)*
3. **Design Validation** ✅ - Task breakdown with file conflict detection *(Gate 3)*
4. **Context Research** 🔬 - Copy-paste ready code examples from top repos
5. **Task Orchestration** 🎯 - Atomic file locking and agent spawning
6. **Implementation** 💻 - 4-5 parallel agents with self-testing *(Gate 4)*
7. **Quality Assurance** ✅ - Comprehensive verification + Chrome testing *(Gate 5)*

**📖 For detailed workflow explanation, see [WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](./WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)**

# 3. Design architecture + UX in parallel (Phase 2)
# 4. Present design for approval (Gate 2)
# 5. Create task breakdown (Phase 3)
# 6. Present tasks for approval (Gate 3)
# 7. Research best practices (Phase 4)
# 8. Implement with parallel agents (Phase 5 & 6)
# 9. Show live progress dashboard (Gate 4)
# 10. Verify quality comprehensively (Phase 7)
