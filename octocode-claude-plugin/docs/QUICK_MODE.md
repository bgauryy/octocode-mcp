# Quick Mode Guide

**NEW in v1.1:** Fast-track development with simplified workflow

## The Problem with Standard Mode

Standard `/octocode-generate`:
- 6 phases with 4 approval gates
- 4 separate documentation files
- Comprehensive but **slower**

**For MVPs, prototypes, and small projects, this is overkill.**

## Quick Mode Solution

New `/octocode-generate-quick`:
- **3 phases** with **1 approval gate**
- **1 consolidated document** (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- **Faster** for most projects
- Fast but still **quality-focused**

## Comparison

| Feature | Quick Mode | Standard Mode |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Command** | `/octocode-generate-quick` | `/octocode-generate` |
| **Agents** | 1 planner + 4-5 implementation | 6 specialized agents |
| **Phases** | 3 | 6 |
| **Gates** | 1 | 4 |
| **Documents** | 1 file (~80KB) | 4 files (~200KB) |
| **Speed** | Faster | Slower |
| **Best For** | MVPs, prototypes, small projects | Complex/enterprise projects |

## Quick Mode Workflow

### Phase 1: Rapid Planning

**agent-rapid-planner** creates complete specification:

```
User Request
     ‚Üì
Ask 2-3 critical questions
     ‚Üì
Research 2-3 similar projects (octocode-mcp)
     ‚Üì
Create PROJECT_SPEC.md:
  - Overview & Requirements
  - Architecture & Design
  - Verification Plan
  - Implementation Tasks
     ‚Üì
‚úã GATE: User approves spec
```

**Single document, everything in one place!**

### Phase 2: Implementation

**agent-manager** + **4-5 agent-implementation** instances:

```
agent-manager reads PROJECT_SPEC.md
     ‚Üì
Assigns tasks to implementation agents
     ‚Üì
Agents work in parallel (file locks prevent conflicts)
     ‚Üì
Progress updated inline in PROJECT_SPEC.md
     ‚Üì
üîÑ User can monitor live (pause/continue)
```

**Parallel execution, same as standard mode!**

### Phase 3: Quality Loops

**agent-rapid-planner** validates:

```
Run build check
     ‚Üì
Run lint check
     ‚Üì
Check TypeScript types
     ‚Üì
Verify feature completeness
     ‚Üì
Issues found? ‚Üí Create fix tasks ‚Üí Loop back to implementation
     ‚Üì
All clean? ‚Üí Mark complete ‚úÖ
```

**Maximum 3 validation loops**

## PROJECT_SPEC.md Structure

Everything in one consolidated document:

```markdown
# Project Specification

## 1. Overview & Requirements
- What we're building (2-3 sentences)
- Must-have features (prioritized list)
- Target users & scale (if relevant)

## 2. Architecture & Design
- Tech stack with rationale
- System architecture (simple diagram)
- Key design decisions
- Database schema (if needed)
- API design (if needed)
- Project structure
- Build & lint setup

## 3. Verification Plan
- Manual testing steps (checklist)
- Quality gates (build, lint, types)

## 4. Implementation Tasks
- Tasks by phase
- Complexity estimates
- Dependencies & parallelization
- Progress tracking (updated live)

---
Created by octocode-mcp
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth
- ‚úÖ Easy to navigate (one file)
- ‚úÖ Everything context-related is together
- ‚úÖ No jumping between 4 files

---

## Example: Building a Todo App

### Quick Mode Timeline

```
1. /octocode-generate-quick "Build a todo app with React and Express"
2. agent-rapid-planner asks 2 questions
3. agent-rapid-planner creates PROJECT_SPEC.md
4. ‚úã GATE: User reviews and approves spec
5. agent-manager assigns tasks to 4 implementation agents
6. Implementation by parallel agents
7. agent-rapid-planner validates (build ‚úÖ, lint ‚úÖ, types ‚úÖ)
8. ‚úÖ Done - Ready for user testing
```

**Quick mode complete**

### Standard Mode Timeline (for comparison)

```
1. /octocode-generate "Build a todo app with React and Express"
2. agent-product creates requirements.md
3. ‚úã Gate 1: Approve requirements
4. agent-architect creates design.md
5. ‚úã Gate 2: Approve architecture
6. agent-quality creates test-plan.md
7. ‚úã Gate 2.5: Approve test plan
8. agent-founding-engineer creates scaffold + README
9. ‚úã Gate 2.75: Approve foundation
10. agent-manager creates tasks.md
11. Implementation begins (4 agents)
12. Implementation complete
13. ‚úÖ Done - Ready for user testing
```

**Standard mode complete**

**Quick mode is faster!**

## Speed Optimizations in Quick Mode

### What Makes It Fast?

1. **Single Planning Agent**
   - No handoffs between product/architect/quality agents
   - All planning happens in one context
   - Faster decisions

2. **Consolidated Documentation**
   - Write once, not 4 times
   - No duplicate information
   - Easier to maintain consistency

3. **One Approval Gate**
   - User reviews once, not 4 times
   - Less back-and-forth
   - Faster to green-light

4. **Same Implementation Quality**
   - Parallel execution still used
   - File locking still prevents conflicts
   - Quality loops catch issues

5. **Focused Questions**
   - 2-3 critical questions only
   - No extensive discovery phase
   - User answers fast

---

## Quality Is Not Compromised

Quick mode is **faster**, not **sloppier**:

### Still Includes:

‚úÖ **Research-driven decisions**
- Uses octocode-mcp to find proven patterns
- Evidence-based architecture choices
- References successful projects (>500‚òÖ)

‚úÖ **Quality validation**
- Build must pass
- Lint must pass
- TypeScript strict mode
- Feature completeness check

‚úÖ **Validation loops**
- Catches issues automatically
- Creates fix tasks
- Re-validates after fixes

‚úÖ **Parallel execution**
- Multiple agents work simultaneously
- File locking prevents conflicts
- Smart task distribution

### Traded Off:

‚ùå **Extensive documentation**
- 1 file vs 4 files
- More concise (but complete)

‚ùå **Multiple review points**
- 1 gate vs 4 gates
- Less checkpoints (but still validated)

‚ùå **Deep discovery**
- 2-3 questions vs longer exploration
- Assumes clearer requirements

## Migration Path

### Already using standard mode?

You can mix modes:

```bash
# Start big project with standard mode for planning
/octocode-generate "Build complex SaaS platform"

# Use quick mode for new features
cd existing-project
/octocode-feature "Add user profiles"
```

### Trying quick mode first?

If project grows complex:

1. Quick mode generates PROJECT_SPEC.md
2. If needed, split into separate docs later
3. Continue with standard mode for next phase

## Tips for Quick Mode Success

### 1. Clear Initial Request

**Good:**
```
/octocode-generate-quick "Build a todo app with React frontend, 
Express backend, and PostgreSQL. Include user authentication."
```

**Better:**
```
/octocode-generate-quick "Build a todo app:
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Express + TypeScript backend
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication
- CRUD operations for todos
- Mark todos complete/incomplete"
```

### 2. Answer Questions Concisely

Agent asks: "Should todos support categories?"

**Good:** "Yes, categories with colors"
**Better:** "Yes, categories table with name and color fields"

### 3. Review Spec Carefully

You only get **one approval gate** - make it count:

- ‚úÖ Check tech stack makes sense
- ‚úÖ Verify all features are listed
- ‚úÖ Review task breakdown
- ‚úÖ Confirm architecture approach

### 4. Trust the Validation Loops

If build/lint fails, agent will:
1. Identify issues
2. Create fix tasks
3. Re-run implementation
4. Validate again

**Let it loop** - don't intervene too early.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Quick mode spec is too brief"

**Solution:** After gate approval, ask agent to expand specific sections:

```
"Expand the database schema section with field types and constraints"
```

Agent will update PROJECT_SPEC.md inline.

### "I need more planning time"

**Solution:** Use standard mode `/octocode-generate` for this project.

Quick mode assumes requirements are relatively clear.

### "Implementation is taking longer than estimated"

**Normal!** Estimates are for planning purposes.

Complex tasks may take longer. Monitor with live dashboard.

### "Quality loop keeps failing"

After loop 3, agent reports issues to you.

Common causes:
- Complex TypeScript types need manual fixes
- API integration issues
- Missing environment variables

**Fix manually** or provide guidance to agents.

---

## Success Metrics

After using quick mode, you should have:

‚úÖ **Fast turnaround** - Project complete quickly
‚úÖ **Working code** - Build, lint, types all pass
‚úÖ **Single spec** - Everything documented in PROJECT_SPEC.md
‚úÖ **Quality validated** - Automated checks passed
‚úÖ **Ready to test** - Manual verification can begin

---

## Roadmap

### Coming Soon

- **Even faster mode:** `/octocode-generate-instant` (AI designs, auto-approves, builds)
- **Templates:** Pre-built specs for common projects (REST API, Next.js app, CLI tool)
- **Spec imports:** Start from existing project structure
- **Cost tracking:** Real-time cost display during generation
