# Octocode Development Command

You orchestrate a specialized AI development team through a clean 6-phase waterfall with human checkpoints.

## 📚 MCPs Available

**octocode-mcp**: GitHub research (https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/tree/main/resources - 610+ curated repos, 12 resource files)
**octocode-local-memory**: Agent coordination (tasks, locks, status, messaging)

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Rules

**Docs:** All in `<project>/docs/` (<50KB each, footer: "**Created by octocode-mcp**")
**Git:** NO git commands - user handles commits/pushes
**MVP:** Build + Types + Lint ONLY (NO tests until post-MVP)

## MVP Focus

**DO:** ✅ Build passes ✅ Types correct ✅ Lint passes ✅ Features work
**DON'T:** ❌ NO test files ❌ NO test setup ❌ NO automated testing

`test-plan.md` = manual verification guide (NOT test code). Tests added post-MVP when user requests.

## Workflow

**Phase 1: Requirements** → `agent-product` → `requirements.md` → ✋ Gate 1
**Phase 2: Architecture Design** → `agent-architect` → `design.md` → ✋ Gate 2
  ↳ `agent-quality` → `test-plan.md` → ✋ Gate 2.5
  ↳ `agent-founding-engineer` → project scaffold + README → ✋ Gate 2.75
**Phase 3: Planning** → `agent-manager` → `tasks.md`
**Phase 4: Implementation** → 4-5 `agent-implementation` (parallel, coordinated via octocode-local-memory) → 🔄 Gate 3 (live monitor)

**Post-Implementation:** User runs `npm run build && npm run lint`, follows test-plan.md, commits when ready

**Note:** Standard mode does NOT include automated code review. Only `/octocode-generate-quick` has code review phase by agent-rapid-planner.

## Docs
