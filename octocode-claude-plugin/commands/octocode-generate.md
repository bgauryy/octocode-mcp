# Octocode Development Command

You orchestrate a specialized AI development team through a clean 7-phase waterfall with human checkpoints.

## ðŸ“š Resources Available

**Curated resources** at https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/tree/main/resources:
- 610+ curated Node.js/TypeScript repositories  
- 12 specialized files (project-examples, architecture, frontend-libs, backend, database, auth, etc.)
- **Usage**: Agents access via octocode-mcp to find proven patterns, then search GitHub for validation

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Important: Documentation Location

**ALL `.octocode/` documentation MUST be created in the GENERATED PROJECT folder.**

Example: If generating project "my-app", all docs go in `my-app/.octocode/`, NOT in the root repository.

## Testing Approach

**Implementation-first, tests later:**
1. Phases 1-7 focus on implementation and functionality
2. Tests are NOT written during initial implementation
3. After Gate 5 approval, user can request test addition as a separate phase
4. This allows faster iteration and user validation before test investment

## 7-Phase Waterfall Flow

```
Phase 1: Requirements    â†’ Gate 1 âœ‹ (User Approval)
Phase 2: Architecture    â†’ Gate 2 âœ‹ (User Approval)  
Phase 3: Validation      â†’ Gate 3 âœ‹ (User Approval)
Phase 4: Research        (Runs in parallel with Phase 5)
Phase 5: Planning        
Phase 6: Implementation  â†’ Gate 4 ðŸ”„ (Live Monitor)
Phase 7: Verification    â†’ Gate 5 âœ‹ (User Approval)
```

### Phase 1: Requirements â†’ Gate 1
**Agent:** `agent-product`  
**Output:** `<project>/.octocode/requirements/*` (PRD, features, user stories)  
**Gate 1:** User approves requirements

### Phase 2: Architecture â†’ Gate 2
**Agent:** `agent-architect`  
**Output:** `<project>/.octocode/designs/*` (architecture, tech stack, API design, database schema)  
**Then:** Creates initial project structure + README.md  
**Gate 2:** User approves architecture  
**Note:** No testing strategy defined yet

### Phase 3: Validation â†’ Gate 3
**Agent:** `agent-design-verification`  
**Input:** Requirements + Architecture  
**Output:** `<project>/.octocode/tasks.md` (task breakdown with dependencies)  
**Gate 3:** User approves task plan  
**Note:** Tasks do NOT include test writing

### Phase 4: Research (Parallel)
**Agent:** `agent-research-context`  
**Input:** Architecture + Tasks  
**Output:** `<project>/.octocode/context/*` (implementation patterns from GitHub)  
**Note:** Runs while planning happens, excludes testing patterns

### Phase 5: Planning
**Agent:** `agent-manager`  
**Input:** Tasks + Context  
**Output:** Execution plan with parallelization strategy

### Phase 6: Implementation â†’ Gate 4
**Agents:** Multiple `agent-implementation` instances  
**Managed by:** `agent-manager` (smart task distribution, progress tracking)  
**Gate 4:** Live dashboard with pause/continue/inspect controls

### Phase 7: Verification â†’ Gate 5
**Agent:** `agent-verification`  
**Tests:** Build, linting, features, performance, security, runtime behavior  
**Output:** `<project>/.octocode/verification-report.md`  
**Gate 5:** User approves for deployment or requests fixes  
**Note:** Existing tests verified if present, but no new tests expected

## State Management

**Checkpoints:** `<project>/.octocode/execution-state.json` (updated after each phase)  
**Logs:** `<project>/.octocode/logs/*` and `<project>/.octocode/debug/*`  
**Resume:** `--resume` flag loads from execution-state.json

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Build passes  
- âœ… Existing tests pass (if any)
- âœ… All PRD features implemented  
- âœ… Runtime verification passes
- âœ… User approves at Gate 5

## Post-Approval: Adding Tests

After Gate 5 approval, user can request test addition:
1. Research testing patterns
2. Create `<project>/.octocode/context/testing-patterns.md`
3. Generate test tasks
4. Implement tests
5. Re-verify with full test coverage

## Start

Launch `agent-product` with the user's request.
