# Octocode Feature Command

You orchestrate a specialized AI development team to add features or fix bugs in **existing codebases** through a clean 6-phase workflow with human checkpoints.

## 📚 Resources Available

**Curated resources** at https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/tree/main/resources:
- 610+ curated Node.js/TypeScript repositories  
- 12 specialized files (project-examples, architecture, frontend-libs, backend, database, auth, etc.)
- **Usage**: Agents access via octocode-mcp to find proven patterns, then search GitHub for validation

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Important: Documentation Location

**ALL documentation goes in `<project>/docs/` folder, NOT `.octocode/` or root repository.**

Work with the current project's `docs/` directory.

**Documentation Standards:**
- Keep each file under 50KB (approximately 600-800 lines, ~12,500 tokens)
- Use clear hierarchical headings and self-contained sections
- Include rich code examples rather than verbose explanations
- If a document exceeds 50KB, split into multiple focused files
- Add footer "**Created by octocode-mcp**" to each created document

## Important: Git Operations

**NO GIT COMMANDS:** Agents only modify local files. User handles all git operations (commits, pushes, branches, etc.).

## 🚨 MVP-First: NO TESTS During Initial Implementation

**Focus on WORKING CODE FIRST (Build + Types + Lint):**

✅ **What we DO during MVP:**
- ✅ Build passes (`npm run build` - no errors)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (strong types, minimal `any`)
- ✅ Lint passes (`npm run lint` - clean code)
- ✅ Feature/fix works as designed
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

❌ **What we DON'T do during MVP:**
- ❌ NO new test files (.test.ts, .spec.ts, __tests__)
- ❌ NO test setup changes
- ❌ NO test coverage requirements
- ❌ NO mocking or test utilities
- ❌ NO automated testing

**Existing tests:**
- If tests already exist in codebase, ensure they still pass
- Do not modify or add new tests during MVP

**Why MVP-first?**
1. **Faster delivery** - See working changes quickly
2. **User validation** - Verify feature works before investing in tests
3. **Flexibility** - User may want adjustments before writing tests
4. **Safe changes** - Focus on not breaking existing code first

**When tests ARE added** (post-MVP, user-requested):
1. User approves working feature/fix
2. User explicitly requests automated test additions
3. Tests implemented as separate phase

## 4-Phase Workflow

```
Phase 1: Code Review      → ✋ Gate 1 (User Approval Required)
Phase 2: Analysis         → ✋ Gate 2 (User Approval Required)
Phase 3: Planning + Task Breakdown
Phase 4: Implementation   → 🔄 Gate 3 (Live Monitor - Final Gate)
```

**Human-in-the-Loop:** 3 approval gates (Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3 live) ensure safe changes

**After Implementation:** User verifies changes manually and runs build/lint checks

### Phase 1: Code Review → Gate 1
**Agent:** `agent-code-review`  
**Output:** `<project>/docs/codebase-review.md` (<50KB)  
**Gate 1:** User approves codebase understanding

### Phase 2: Feature/Bug Analysis → Gate 2
**Agent:** `agent-feature-analyzer`
**Output:** `<project>/docs/analysis.md` (<50KB)
**Gate 2:** User approves implementation plan
**Note:** Plan does NOT include test writing. Agent uses Octocode MCP to research proven patterns during analysis.

### Phase 3: Planning
**Agent:** `agent-manager` (EXISTING)
**Input:** analysis.md + codebase-review.md
**Output:** `<project>/docs/tasks.md` (<50KB) with execution plan

### Phase 4: Implementation → Gate 3 (Final)
**Agents:** Multiple `agent-implementation` instances (EXISTING)
**Managed by:** `agent-manager` (smart task distribution, progress in tasks.md)
**Gate 3:** Live dashboard with pause/continue/inspect controls - Final approval gate

**After Implementation Completes:**
- User runs build/lint checks (`npm run build && npm run lint`)
- User manually verifies changes don't break existing functionality
- User decides when to commit based on their verification

## Documentation Structure

**Simple & focused** - All docs in `<project>/docs/`:

| File | Owner | Purpose | Size | Human Gate |
|------|-------|---------|------|------------|
| `codebase-review.md` | agent-code-review | Existing code analysis | <50KB | ✋ Gate 1 |
| `analysis.md` | agent-feature-analyzer | Feature/bug analysis + patterns | <50KB | ✋ Gate 2 |
| `tasks.md` | agent-manager | Task breakdown + progress | <50KB | (live) |

**3 single files (<50KB each), clear ownership, human approval at key gates**

**All files must include footer:** `**Created by octocode-mcp**`

## Success Criteria

### For Features:
- ✅ Feature implemented as specified
- ✅ Existing tests pass (if any)
- ✅ No existing features broken
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Runtime verification passes

### For Bugs:
- ✅ Bug reproducible before fix
- ✅ Bug not reproducible after fix
- ✅ No regression in related features
- ✅ Existing tests pass

## Post-Approval: Adding Automated Tests

After verification approval, user can request automated test addition:
1. Research testing patterns for the codebase
2. Add "Testing Patterns" section to verification.md
3. Generate test tasks (append to tasks.md)
4. Implement automated tests (unit + integration)
5. Re-verify with full test coverage

## Start

Launch `agent-code-review` to analyze the existing codebase.
