# Octocode Clean Code

Cut dead weight — shims, re-exports, duplicates, patch kludges, junk prose, redundant schemas, dependency junk, oversized config, god files, and misplaced files — without changing observable behavior.

Flow: `SCOPE → AUDIT → INVENTORY → TRIAGE → CONSENT → EXCISE → VERIFY`.

Workspace output contract: chat-only findings stay in chat. Saved inventory reports default to `<workspace>/.octocode/octocode-clean-code/`; scratch evidence uses `<workspace>/.octocode/tmp/octocode-clean-code/`. Source mutations keep their named paths. Never fall back to a user-level Octocode home for artifacts.

## Lobby rules
- Prove zero external callers before deleting any shim, alias, re-export, or adapter. LSP callers + graph import edges are both required.
- Never change behavior. If removal requires a behavioral change, flag it and stop.
- Batch into safe increments; run the project's own checks after each batch.
- Respect explicit user scope; only widen to the full repository when no scope is given or user approves.
- One excision batch per consent gate; do not pre-empt by removing anything unapproved.
- Config hygiene changes affecting runtime behavior require explicit consent.
- Never touch lock files, generated output, or build artifacts.

## Smell classes

| Class | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Dead exports | re-exports, barrel aliases, legacy adapter shims, compatibility stubs |
| Duplicate logic | copy-pasted blocks, near-identical helpers, redundant utility wrappers |
| Patch kludges | inline regex fixups, monkey-patches, always-true environment conditionals |
| Junk prose | syntax-narration comments, dead comment blocks, god documentation, stale TODOs |
| Schema / type redundancy | type aliases that just re-name, duplicate interfaces, stale protocol stubs, redundant enums |
| Dependency junk | unused deps, duplicate declarations, version misalignment, phantom deps, workspace-protocol violations |
| Test debt | numbered/dated iteration files, skipped tests with no ticket, rigid mocks coupling to private internals, redundant stubs with no expect reference, environment-coupled tests, unused beforeEach/afterEach setup |

## Smart routes — load only what the current step needs
- When starting the cleanup run or choosing between phases (SCOPE, AUDIT, INVENTORY, TRIAGE, CONSENT, EXCISE, VERIFY), load `references/cleanup-playbook.md` — per-phase run with per-class audit queries, inventory table, and check contract.
- When classifying a smell as shim, re-export, duplicate, alias, or patch kludge, load `references/smell-catalog.md` — full taxonomy with detection queries and confidence rules for each class.
- When evaluating file placement, folder cohesion, god-file size, or god-folder concerns, load `references/hierarchy-rules.md` — one-file-one-concern, one-folder-one-domain, size limits, and move protocol.
- When reviewing inline comments or documentation files for verbosity, dead prose, or god-doc patterns, load `references/doc-hygiene.md` — cut/keep rules for comments, JSDoc, and documentation files.
- When inspecting config files for length, redundant keys, or misplaced settings, load `references/config-hygiene.md` — config hygiene rules, type-specific length limits, and consent gate.
- When reviewing type definitions, interfaces, enums, schemas, or protocol shapes for redundancy or aliasing, load `references/schema-hygiene.md` — type-alias rules, duplicate interface detection, and protocol stub evidence bar.
- When auditing package.json files for unused, duplicate, misaligned, or phantom dependencies across the repo, load `references/dependency-hygiene.md` — unused-dep checks, version alignment, workspace-protocol rules, and consent gate.
- When the task involves removing numbered/dated iteration test files, skipped tests, rigid mocks, redundant stubs, or unused test setup, load `references/test-hygiene.md` — test smell catalog, detection queries, evidence bar, and excision protocol.
- When writing replacement tests after removing legacy or rigid ones (to recover lost coverage), load `references/test-quality.md` — isolation patterns, naming conventions, and the coverage replacement rule.
- When symbol proof, caller lists, import graphs, or structural search are needed, load `references/octocode.md` — tool routing for LSP, graph, and structural queries.

## Related routes
- Use `octocode-research` for blast-radius mapping before deletions; `octocode-roast` for a blunt smell inventory; `octocode-eval-benchmark` to measure before/after metrics.
- Use `octocode-skills` when changing this skill folder.

## Scripts
None — instruction-only. Proof uses `octocode-research` and the project's own repository tools; verification runs the project's own test suite.
