Load when context, tool work, caches, memory, queues, or repeated computation need a measured end-to-end audit.

# Resource-flow audit

Use the agentic-plumber metaphor only to label duties. Trace one representative request through inputs, loaders, serializers, tool calls, handoffs, stores, retries, and consumers; map each observed issue to its owning boundary.

| Examine | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Supply | User input, instructions, retrieved evidence, tool output, memory: origin and purpose |
| Pipes/junctions | Loaders, transforms, queues, parsers, handoffs, consumers, and required fields |
| Leaks/clogs | Repeated reads, copies, retries, slow stages, output limits, queue growth |
| Tanks/valves | Cache keys, scope, freshness, invalidation, buffers, selection, cancellation |
| Quality/meter | Contradictory instructions, provenance, intended action; tokens/cache counters, bytes, CPU, memory, I/O, latency, correctness |

## Map, meter, diagnose, repair, replay

1. The orchestrator assigns a plumber actor one representative task, baseline, correctness check, and units. The actor maps the effective consumer payload and names unavailable observations.
2. Measure boundaries and state a rival cause. Token count is not heap, CPU, or algorithmic complexity; persistent agent memory is not process memory.
3. Trace the largest demonstrated issue to its owner: `octocode-agentic-prompts` for effective instructions, `octocode-research` for evidence/tool semantics, `octocode-architect` for code/dataflow/lifetime, and `octocode-eval-benchmark` for comparisons. `octocode-context-audit` is an optional inventory helper when installed.
4. Repair loop (PDCA): plan from the step 1 baseline, correctness check, and units; do one authorized correction that preserves required evidence and continuations; check by replaying the same acceptance conditions against the baseline; act by keeping the change only when its benefit survives comparison without lost correctness or evidence, else revert it. A flow tester actor is useful only when it can independently check correctness or replicate a comparable measurement.
5. Record bottleneck, owner, change, before/after, and gaps in the shared ledger.

Do not trim required instructions or tool-result evidence for a token metric; do not assume a cache hit from latency; do not add a cache without reuse and invalidation evidence. Uncertain mutation and sealed evaluation constraints from [verification](verification.md) and the domain owner still apply.
