# Skill review rules

Load when interpreting or fixing review findings — after running `scripts/skill-review.mjs`. Why: map each code to the exact gap.

## ERROR (exit 1)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `frontmatter-missing` | `SKILL.md` starts with YAML frontmatter |
| `name-mismatch` | frontmatter `name` equals the folder name |
| `description-missing` | non-empty `description` |
| `description-too-long` | `description` ≤1024 chars |
| `missing-route` | every routed `references/*` and `scripts/*` path exists |
| `link-outside-skill` | no dependency on a file outside the folder — no `../dir/file`, `~/`, `file://`, or absolute path (a bare `../dir` argument is fine, as is a path carrying a `<placeholder>`) |
| `octocode-contract-stale` | use current public Octocode tool names and `octocode skill install/list/info` command forms |
| `unused-file` | every shipped file is reachable from `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, or another used file; remove development-only metadata, probes, duplicates, and dead weight |

## WARN codes → fix

| Code | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `description-trigger` | lead with `Use when <trigger>` |
| `lobby-long` | keep `SKILL.md` lean; move depth into one-concept refs |
| `readme-missing` | add `README.md`: overview, capabilities, how it works, install |
| `reference-h1` | one short H1 per reference |
| `reference-long` | one concept per file; split and cross-link |
| `orphan-reference` | route it from `SKILL.md` or another reference, or delete it |
| `lobby-reference-unlisted` | name the reference in `SKILL.md` with when to read it |
| `lobby-script-unlisted` | name the runnable script in `SKILL.md` with when and how to run it |
| `lobby-workflow-missing` | show the workflow on its own line in `SKILL.md` — a `Flow:` line or a `## Workflow` heading, not trailing mid-sentence |
| `script-unreferenced` | a library nothing imports: import it, name it, or drop it |
| `route-condition` | state when or why on the same line as the ref or script |
| `reference-entry-cue` | open the chunk with `Load when …` and `Why:` |
| `reference-dead-end` | end with the next hop, or say the step ends here |
| `flow-phase-unrouted` | name each flow phase in a route or gate, or drop it from the flow |

Navigation codes treat the skill as a map. `SKILL.md` lists every reference, runnable script, workflow, and usage condition. Each chunk declares its entry and points onward. Audit trails, templates, and fixtures skip entry/exit cues. A concrete directory route includes its files; write schematic paths with a placeholder such as `scripts/<hook-directory>/` so the reviewer does not require that example to ship.

## Judgment checks the script cannot make

| Check | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Duplicate or weak prose | one owner per concept; cross-link instead of restating; use direct verbs and named objects; cut filler without losing data |
| Output and gates | real markdown table for tabular data; complete gate sections |
| `description` quality | one `Use when`; intents, not internals; no MUST/NEVER/ONLY-skill, second `Triggers:`, or quote spam |
| Scripts and hooks | `--help` and flags; extract deterministic prose; route hook + `timeout`; a declared scheme is really exposed |
| Portability | core commands run in a single-folder copy; optional integrations declare their dependency and setup, and pass documented tests with it absent/present |
| Workspace artifacts | lobby routes generated files under `<workspace>/.octocode/`, distinguishes requested source mutations, and forbids user-level fallback |

Key limits: references stay inside the skill; every shipped file is used; each `references/*.md` ≤50 lines with one short H1; every reference and runnable script is named in the lobby. Next: when re-running the loop load `references/skill-review.md`; for design rationale load `references/skill-anatomy.md`. <!-- style-lint: ignore-line passive-voice -->
