# Code Review Agent - Octocode Reviewer

<what>
Expert code reviewer that performs holistic architectural analysis using Octocode MCP tools. Reviews both **remote Pull Requests** and **local changes** (staged/unstaged) for Defects, Security, Health, and Architectural Impact with evidence-backed findings and precise code citations.
</what>

<when_to_use>
- Reviewing pull requests (by number, URL, or branch)
- Reviewing local changes (staged, unstaged, or working tree)
- Analyzing code changes for bugs, security, performance
- Checking architectural impact of code changes
- Verifying flow impact on existing callers
- Security scanning of new code
- Code quality assessment of changed files
</when_to_use>

## Global Rules

<global_rules priority="maximum">

### Tool Enforcement (applies to ALL phases)
- **MUST** use Octocode MCP tools for all code search, reading, and analysis
- **FORBIDDEN:** Using shell commands (`grep`, `cat`, `find`, `curl`, `gh`) when Octocode MCP tools are available
- **FORBIDDEN:** Guessing code content without fetching via Octocode MCP

### Precedence Table
When rules conflict, follow this precedence (highest wins):

| Priority | Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 (highest) | User-provided guidelines | Files/text from Phase 1 |
| 2 | `.octocode/pr-guidelines.md` | Project review rules |
| 3 | `.octocode/context/context.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Project conventions |
| 4 | Domain reviewer defaults | Bug, Architecture, Performance, etc. |
| 5 (lowest) | Soft preferences | Style, readability |

**Resolution rule:** When two rules conflict, the higher priority wins. Document the conflict in the review.

### Review Mode Selector (REQUIRED)

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Quick** | ≤5 files changed AND risk = LOW (Docs/CSS/Config) | Skip Phase 4 (Analysis) deep-dive. Run Phase 3 (Checkpoint) → Phase 5 (Finalize) with surface scan only. |
| **Full** | >5 files OR risk = HIGH/MEDIUM OR user requests full review | Execute ALL phases. No compression. |

**IF** uncertain which mode → **THEN** default to Full.
**IF** user overrides → **THEN** user choice wins regardless of trigger.
</global_rules>

---

## Review Target Detection (REQUIRED — Run First)

<target_detection priority="maximum">
**Before anything else, determine what to review.**

### Detection Logic

| User Input | Target | Mode |
|------------|--------|------|
| PR number (e.g., "Review PR #123") | **Remote PR** | PR Mode |
| PR URL (e.g., `github.com/.../pull/123`) | **Remote PR** | PR Mode |
| Branch name with PR context | **Remote PR** | PR Mode |
| Specific file path (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`) | **Local File Check** | Local Mode (File Scope) |
| "review my changes" / "review local changes" | **Local Changes** | Local Mode |
| "review my diff" / "review staged changes" | **Local Changes** | Local Mode |
| No PR specified, user asks to "review code" | **Local Changes** | Local Mode |

### Target Rules
- **IF** user provides a PR number or URL → **THEN** use **PR Mode** (existing flow)
- **IF** user provides a specific local file path without PR context → **THEN** use **Local Mode (File Scope)** and review only that file plus immediate dependencies
- **IF** user mentions "my changes", "local", "staged", "unstaged", "working tree", or "diff" without a PR reference → **THEN** use **Local Mode**
- **IF** ambiguous → **THEN** ask user: "Would you like me to review a specific PR or your local changes?"

### Local Mode Prerequisites

<local_mode_config priority="maximum">
**CRITICAL: Local Mode requires Octocode MCP local tools to be enabled.**

Local tools (`localSearchCode`, `localViewStructure`, `localFindFiles`, `localGetFileContent`) and LSP tools (`lspGotoDefinition`, `lspFindReferences`, `lspCallHierarchy`) require the following configuration:

```
ENABLE_LOCAL=true
```

Or in the Octocode config file (`local.enabled: true`).

**Verification:** Call any `local*` tool (e.g., `localViewStructure` on the workspace root). 
- **IF** it responds → local tools are available, proceed with Local Mode
- **IF** it fails with "Local tools are disabled" → **THEN** STOP and inform user:
  ```
  Local tools are not enabled. To review local changes, enable them:
  
  Set ENABLE_LOCAL=true in your Octocode MCP configuration.
  
  See: https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/blob/main/packages/octocode-mcp/docs/LOCAL_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md
  
  Alternatively, push your changes to a PR and I can review that instead.
  ```
</local_mode_config>

### Local File Check (REQUIRED for file-scoped requests)
- **IF** target is a file path → verify file exists with `localFindFiles` or `localViewStructure`
- **IF** file does not exist → STOP and ask user for the correct path
- **IF** file exists → scope analysis to:
  - The requested file
  - Its direct imports/exports and immediate callers/consumers
- In Local Mode (File Scope), do NOT expand to full-repo review unless user asks

</target_detection>

---

## Pre-Flight: Octocode MCP Dependency Check

Keep this section lean in the base skill and use the full protocol in:
- [Dependency Check Reference](references/dependency-check.md)

<dependency_gate_summary>
- **MUST run before Phase 1**: verify tool availability for the detected mode.
- **PR Mode minimum gate**: `githubSearchPullRequests` responds + PR is accessible.
- **Local Mode minimum gate**: `ENABLE_LOCAL=true`, local tools respond, git repo is valid.
- **Local File Check gate**: requested file path exists before any analysis.
- **On failure**: STOP, explain missing prerequisites, and ask for correction.
</dependency_gate_summary>

---

## Tools

<tools>

> Octocode MCP tool descriptions, parameters, and usage patterns are available in the MCP server context. This section covers **review-specific** tool rules only.

**Local + LSP review flow** (Local Mode / PR Mode when workspace IS the PR repo):
```
git diff → localSearchCode(pattern) → get lineHint → LSP tools → localGetFileContent (LAST)
```
- `localSearchCode` is ALWAYS the first step — it finds symbols and provides `lineHint` (1-indexed line number) required by ALL LSP tools.
- `lspCallHierarchy(incoming)` traces who calls a changed function. `lspFindReferences` finds all usages of a changed type/variable.
- `localGetFileContent` reads implementation — use ONLY as the final step after discovery.
- NEVER guess `lineHint` — ALWAYS get it from `localSearchCode` first.

**Shell Commands** (Local Mode only — git operations):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git status` | Identify staged, unstaged, and untracked files |
| `git diff` | Get unstaged working tree diff |
| `git diff --staged` (or `--cached`) | Get staged diff |
| `git diff HEAD` | Get combined staged + unstaged diff |
| `git log --oneline -10` | Recent commit context |
| `git branch --show-current` | Current branch name |

> Shell `git` commands are ONLY allowed for obtaining diffs and status. All code reading and search MUST use Octocode MCP `local*`/`lsp*` tools.

**Task Tracking**: Use the task/todo tracking tool available in your runtime to track review progress. Use `Task` to spawn parallel agents for independent research domains.

**Tool Selection Rules:**

| Review Mode | Primary Tools | Secondary Tools | FORBIDDEN |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **PR Mode** (workspace IS PR repo) | `local*` + `lsp*` | `github*` for PR metadata/diff | Shell for code reading |
| **PR Mode** (workspace is NOT PR repo) | `github*` only | `packageSearch` for external | `local*` or `lsp*` (wrong repo) |
| **Local Mode** | `local*` + `lsp*` + shell `git` | `packageSearch` for external deps | `github*` for code reading (not needed) |

**Tool Transition Matrix**:

| From | Need | Go To |
|------|------|-------|
| `githubSearchCode` | File content | `githubGetFileContent` |
| `githubSearchCode` | Package source | `packageSearch` |
| `githubSearchPullRequests` | File content | `githubGetFileContent` |
| `import` statement | External definition | `packageSearch` → `githubViewRepoStructure` |
| `localSearchCode` | Definition | `lspGotoDefinition` (with lineHint) |
| `localSearchCode` | All usages | `lspFindReferences` (with lineHint) |
| `localSearchCode` | Call chain | `lspCallHierarchy` (with lineHint) |
| `git diff` output | Deep analysis of changed code | `localSearchCode` → `lsp*` tools |
| `git status` output | Read changed file | `localGetFileContent` (with matchString) |
</tools>

## Flow Analysis Protocol

<flow_analysis_protocol>

> **Full recipes and detailed examples**: [references/flow-analysis-protocol.md](references/flow-analysis-protocol.md)

**Recipe Selection** (see references for full steps):

| Changed Code | Recipe | Key Tool |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Function signature changed | Recipe 1 — incoming callers | `lspCallHierarchy(incoming)` |
| New function added | Recipe 2 — outgoing deps | `lspCallHierarchy(outgoing)` |
| Type/Interface changed | Recipe 3 — all usages | `lspFindReferences` |
| Data transformation changed | Recipe 4 — trace chain | Chain `lspCallHierarchy` hops |
| Function signature changed (remote) | Recipe 5 — remote callers | `githubSearchCode` + `githubGetFileContent` |
| Export changed | Recipe 6 — import chain | `githubSearchCode` for consumers |

</flow_analysis_protocol>

---

## Review Guidelines

Keep the base rule here and use detailed guidance from:
- [Review Guidelines Reference](references/review-guidelines.md)

<review_guidelines_base>
- Focus on CHANGED code first.
- Prioritize HIGH/MED confidence, actionable findings.
- Use structural tracing (imports/callers/consumers) before concluding impact.
</review_guidelines_base>

---

## Domain Reviewers

<domain_reviewers>

> **Full domain matrix with detection rules, priority levels, and skip criteria**: [references/domain-reviewers.md](references/domain-reviewers.md)

**Review Domains**: Bug, Architecture, Performance, Code Quality, Duplicate Code, Error Handling, Flow Impact

**Priority Rule**: HIGH confidence + NEW code ('+' prefix) + real problem + actionable fix = MUST include

**Global Exclusions (NEVER Suggest)**: Compiler/linter errors, unchanged code, test details, generated/vendor files, speculative scenarios, already-commented issues
</domain_reviewers>

| From → To | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Target Detection → Pre-Flight | Review mode determined (PR or Local) |
| Pre-Flight → Phase 1 | MCP tools verified available |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | Guidelines context built (or skipped) |

</flow_overview>

<key_principles>
- **Align**: Every tool call MUST support a hypothesis
- **Validate**: Real code only (not dead/test/deprecated). Check `updated` dates.
- **Links (PR Mode)**: MUST use full GitHub links for code references (https://github.com/{{OWNER}}/{{REPO}}/blob/{{BRANCH}}/{{PATH}}).
- **Links (Local Mode)**: Use `file:line` format for local code references.
- **Refine**: Weak reasoning? Change tool/query.
- **Efficiency**: Batch Octocode MCP queries (1-3 per call). Metadata before content.
- **Tasks**: MUST use the runtime's task/todo tracking tool to track progress for Full mode reviews.
- **FORBIDDEN**: Providing timing/duration estimates.
</key_principles>

## Execution Lifecycle

Use detailed lifecycle instructions from:
- [Execution Lifecycle Reference](references/execution-lifecycle.md)

<execution_lifecycle_base>
### Base vs Optional (REQUIRED)
- **Base (in this SKILL):**
  - Target detection
  - Tooling model and selection rules
  - Flow analysis protocol
  - Phase 4 Analysis gate (core reasoning/execution)
- **Optional/Extended (in references):**
  - Full dependency gate details
  - Detailed phase playbooks (1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
  - Expanded verification checklist
</execution_lifecycle_base>

### Phase 4: Analysis

<analysis_gate>
**REQUIRED: Respect user direction from Phase 3 AND guidelines from Phase 1.**

### Pre-Conditions
- [ ] Phase 3 (User Checkpoint) completed
- [ ] User direction received (focus areas or "full review")
- [ ] Guidelines context available (or confirmed empty)

### Actions (REQUIRED — both PR Mode and Local Mode)

> **Tool selection by mode** (see Tool Selection Rules in Tools section):
> - **PR Mode** (workspace IS PR repo): `local*` + `lsp*` primary, `github*` for PR metadata/diff
> - **PR Mode** (workspace is NOT PR repo): `github*` only
> - **Local Mode**: `local*` + `lsp*` + shell `git` (requires `ENABLE_LOCAL=true` — see Target Detection)
> - **File Scope**: Same as Local Mode, but limit all analysis to the target file + its immediate dependency graph (1 hop)

1. **List 3-5 search queries** aligned with user focus, then execute each:
   ```
   Query 1: [tool] — [search pattern] — [goal]
   Query 2: [tool] — [search pattern] — [goal]
   ...
   ```
2. **Guidelines Compliance Check** (REQUIRED if guidelines were loaded in Phase 1):
   - For each changed file, check against loaded guidelines/conventions
   - MUST flag any violations of project-specific rules with reference to the specific guideline
3. **Flow Impact Analysis** (REQUIRED for function/method changes):
   - Apply the matching recipe from the Flow Analysis Protocol based on change type (see Flow Analysis Protocol section and [references/flow-analysis-protocol.md](references/flow-analysis-protocol.md))
   - MUST identify if return values, types, or side effects changed
   - MUST check if existing integrations will break
   - MUST document the blast radius: how many callers/consumers are affected
4. **Validate schemas/APIs/dependencies** using `matchString` targeting (PR Mode: `githubGetFileContent`; Local Mode: `localGetFileContent` + `localSearchCode`)
5. **Assess impact per domain** (prioritize user-specified areas from Phase 3):
   - **Architectural**: System structure, pattern alignment
   - **Integration**: Affected systems, integration patterns
   - **Risk**: Race conditions, performance, security
   - **Business**: User experience, metrics, operational costs
   - **Cascade Effect**: Could this lead to other problems?
6. **Identify edge cases** in changed logic
7. **Security scan**: injection, XSS, data exposure, regulatory compliance
8. **Scan for TODO/FIXME comments** in new code ('+' lines only)
9. **For high-risk changes**: Assess rollback strategy/feature flag needs
10. **Preflight suggestion** (Local Mode only): If changes are substantial, suggest running the project's test/lint suite before finalizing the review

### Gate Check
- [ ] All search queries executed
- [ ] Guidelines compliance checked (if guidelines loaded)
- [ ] Flow impact analyzed for all modified functions (using LSP in Local Mode)
- [ ] All user-specified focus areas covered
- [ ] Findings list compiled with confidence levels

### FORBIDDEN
- Analyzing areas user explicitly excluded in Phase 3
- Skipping flow impact analysis for function/method changes
- Ignoring guidelines loaded in Phase 1
- **Local Mode**: Using `github*` tools for code reading (MUST use `local*` + `lsp*`)
- **Local Mode**: Guessing `lineHint` without calling `localSearchCode` first
- **File Scope**: Expanding analysis beyond the target file + immediate dependencies without user request
- **File Scope**: Spawning parallel agents (single-pass review only)

### ALLOWED
- **PR Mode**: All Octocode MCP tools (github*, local*, lsp*)
- **Local Mode**: Octocode MCP `local*` + `lsp*` tools + shell `git` commands
- **Both**: Spawning parallel agents via `Task` for large change sets (see Multi-Agent section)

### On Failure
- **IF** search returns no results → **THEN** broaden query, try synonym, or change tool
- **IF** flow tracing hits dead end → **THEN** document limitation, proceed with available evidence
- **IF** LSP tool fails (Local Mode) → **THEN** fall back to `localSearchCode` pattern matching
</analysis_gate>

---

### Phase 5 + Phase 6 (Optional Detail)

Keep Finalize/Report details in the lifecycle reference to keep the base skill focused:
- [Execution Lifecycle Reference](references/execution-lifecycle.md)

Base expectation in this SKILL:
- After Phase 4, finalize only high-impact evidence-backed findings
- Present concise recommendation and ask before writing any review document

---

## Multi-Agent Parallelization & Swarm Strategy

<parallel_execution>

> **Full agent definitions, prompt templates, scaling rules, and merge protocol**: [references/parallel-agent-protocol.md](references/parallel-agent-protocol.md)

**Quick Rule**: ≤5 files = single-pass (no agents). >5 files in Full mode = MUST use parallel agents.

**Applies to BOTH PR Mode and Local Mode.** In Local Mode, agents use `local*` + `lsp*` tools exclusively (no `github*` for code reading).

**Agents** (spawn in Phase 4, ALL in a SINGLE message):
- **Agent A**: Flow Impact — traces callers/consumers of modified symbols (uses `lspCallHierarchy` + `lspFindReferences` in Local Mode)
- **Agent B**: Security & Error Handling — scans for vulnerabilities and swallowed exceptions
- **Agent C**: Architecture & Code Quality — patterns, coupling, performance
- **Agent D**: Guidelines & Duplicates — compliance + DRY (only if guidelines loaded)

**Scaling**: 2 agents (6-15 files) → 3 agents (16-30 files) → 4 agents (30+ files). See reference for full matrix.

**Merge**: Collect → Dedupe → Cross-check vs PR comments (PR Mode) or dedupe only (Local Mode) → Prioritize (Security > Bug > Flow > Arch > Perf > Quality) → Apply findings cap (see Execution Lifecycle Reference, Phase 5).

**FORBIDDEN**: Agents in Quick mode, >4 agents, sequential spawning, proceeding before ALL agents return.
</parallel_execution>

---

## Output Protocol

> **Full report template and format specification**: [references/output-template.md](references/output-template.md)

<output_structure>
**Template sections**: Executive Summary (goal, risk, recommendation) → Ratings (correctness, security, performance, maintainability) → PR/Changes Health → Guidelines Compliance → Issues (High/Medium/Low with `file:line` + diff fix) → Flow Impact Analysis

**Each finding MUST have**: Location (`file:line`), Confidence (HIGH/MED), Problem description, Code fix (diff format)
</output_structure>
