# Code Research

Load for code investigation, review, refactor, architecture, dead-code, or blast-radius work. Read `references/algorithm.md` and `references/problem-framing.md` first; load the matching `references/workflow-*.md` route before this proof ladder.

## Route
| Need | First proof path |
|---|---|
| bug | reproduction → violated contract → hypotheses → divergence boundary → causal/counterfactual proof |
| feature | capability gap → acceptance criteria → consumers → options/local pattern → patch/checks |
| enhancement | baseline → bottleneck → measurable target → experiment/change → regression guard |
| unknown behavior | actual/authority evidence → classify → matching route |
| refactor (preserve behavior) | skeleton → contracts → blast → big→small tasks → bulk move/rewire → verify (`workflow-refactor.md`) |
| PR/local review | changed region → symbols → consumers/tests → ranked findings |
| dead code/delete | `astSearch(operation:"topology", analysis:"deadCode")` candidate → exact read → LSP/AST/broad text/tests |
| architecture | entry points → graph dependencies/dependents/reachability/cycles → exact boundaries → tradeoffs |

## Workflow
1. State goal, scope, and expected output: research, review, plan, or patch.
2. Use known anchors directly; map unfamiliar structure or changed scope when needed. Keep an alternate hypothesis for causal claims.
3. Read exact slices; use `astSearch` topology for file relationships, `astSearch` match for shape, and `lspSearch` for symbol identity.
4. For edits, find a local pattern, and patch only the evidence-supported boundary.
5. Run the declared test/build/typecheck/lint/smoke or deterministic read/search check.
6. On failure, keep the receipt, reread the failing path, patch only the cause, or report the exact block.
7. Report `confirmed`, `likely`, or `uncertain`; snippets and model judgment remain leads.

## Gates
Apply the authorization rule in `SKILL.md`; record consequences of contract or cross-package changes before editing.

Review findings lead and include `file:line`, impact, evidence, confidence, and fix. Changes cannot claim success until verification runs; unavailable checks cap confidence below confirmed.

## Proof Ladder
`candidate → exact evidence → claim-specific corroboration → applicable verification → verdict`. AST, LSP, and graph are alternatives or complements, not compulsory consecutive calls.

| Finding | Minimum corroboration |
|---|---|
| dead export / safe delete | `astSearch(operation:"topology", analysis:"deadCode")` or search candidate + LSP excluding declaration + AST/imports + tests/build |
| dependency cycle | `astSearch(operation:"topology", analysis:"cycles")`; inspect exact imports before a change claim |
| affected scope / reachability | graph `dependents`/`path`/`reachability` + exact reads + LSP references/callers for changed symbols |
| security sink | sink shape + exact read + source/callers + guard/sanitizer check |
| test gap | important/changed symbol + no test refs + nearby test-tree read |
| coupling/god function | fan proxies + mixed responsibilities + callers/callees |
| performance | exact hot/independent path; benchmark only when runtime proof matters |

Dismiss a candidate when stronger proof contradicts it and state the reason briefly. Final output names claim, anchor, proof, confidence, impact, next action, and any deterministic check not run.

Next: when the proven claim needs an edit go to `references/workflow-change.md` (behavior) or `references/workflow-refactor.md` (structure); when it is a review finding go to `references/workflow-pr-review-analysis.md`; when proof keeps flipping load `references/loop-mode.md`. Otherwise the ladder ends here — report the verdict.
