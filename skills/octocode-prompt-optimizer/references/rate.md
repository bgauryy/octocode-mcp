# RATE
Load after UNDERSTAND and before FIX. Why: evidence and severity keep the repair proportional.
## Issue Scan
| Severity | Categories |
|---|---|
| Critical | weak modal inside a truly critical rule; safety/permission conflict |
| High | missing enforcement; ambiguous action/referent; intent-changing contradiction; a rule that states a preference with no decidable boundary, or names a boundary with no form applicable during generation |
| Medium | missing output/gate; duplication; low density; imprecise term; buried rule; unmarked example/data; irrelevant metadata; a rule owned by the wrong layer (schema detail in a description, workflow in a schema) |
| Low | indirect/wordy sentence; repeated example; cosmetic residue; motivational or role-play framing |

Keep optional modals optional. Preserve required frontmatter and exact commands.

## Score

Score 1–5, then average: A 4.5–5 · B 3.5–4.4 · C 2.5–3.4 · D <2.5.
| Dimension | 5 means |
|---|---|
| Clarity | concrete verbs, stable terms, explicit referents |
| Enforcement | proportionate boundaries and phase gates |
| Structure | visible order; separated examples/data where needed |
| Density | every sentence defines a distinction, sets a boundary, explains a consequence, or directs an action; one owner per rule |
| Output | concrete shape for every required deliverable |
| Integrity | preserved intent, metadata, branches, and commands |

Rate every logical part, cite evidence, and avoid inflating severity. If the scan is unexpectedly clean, recheck modals, referents, conflicts, branches, and outputs once.

Next: with issues and a before score recorded load `references/fix.md`; when a severity rests on assumed behavior rather than evidence load `references/evaluation-data.md` first; when the issue is a precedence conflict load `references/patterns.md`; when the input is a multi-tool MCP server load `references/contract-audit.md` to rate the set rather than each tool.
