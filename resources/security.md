## Application Security

### OWASP Top 10 (2025)

The OWASP Top 10:2025 is scheduled for release at the OWASP Global AppSec Conference in November 2025. Current key security risks include:

1. **Broken Access Control** - Failures in restricting user permissions leading to unauthorized access
2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Improper encryption exposing sensitive data
3. **Injection** (including XSS) - User input manipulation attacks
4. **Insecure Design** - Security flaws in architecture and design phase
5. **Security Misconfiguration** - Improper security settings across the stack
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Using libraries with known vulnerabilities
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures** - Weak authentication mechanisms
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Compromised CI/CD pipelines and supply chain
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Insufficient visibility into security events
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Unauthorized server-side requests

### Essential Application Security Practices

- **Access Control**: Implement "default deny" with server-side validation
- **Data Protection**: Use AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Password Security**: Use bcrypt or Argon2 for hashing, never plain text
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user input, use prepared statements for databases
- **Secure Design**: Integrate threat modeling from the start of development
- **Shift-Left Security**: Test security at commit time, not just pre-deployment

## Secrets Management

### Critical Issue: Secrets Sprawl

**2025 Secrets Management Challenges**
- **96% of organizations struggle with secrets sprawl** (credentials scattered across code, configs, scripts)
- **88% of data breaches involved compromised credentials** (Verizon 2025 Report)
- **Agentic AI complications**: Autonomous agents generate and rotate secrets faster than humans can track
- **Non-human access**: Automation and service accounts create exponential growth in secrets

### Secrets Management Best Practices

**Never Commit Secrets to Version Control**
- Use .gitignore to exclude .env, credentials files, and config files with secrets
- Scan commits for accidentally committed secrets using pre-commit hooks
- Use tools like GitGuardian or TruffleHog to detect secrets in repositories
- If secrets are exposed, rotate them immediately - removing from Git history isn't enough

**Automated Lifecycle Management**
- Implement automated creation, distribution, rotation, and destruction
- High-risk secrets should rotate daily; infrastructure certificates monthly
- Eliminate manual processes to prevent human error
- Use automated rotation schedules based on secret sensitivity

**Shift-Left Security**
- Scan for secrets at the PR level before merging
- Integrate secrets scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Allow developers to fix issues before they reach production
- Use pre-commit hooks for local secret detection

**Access Control & Auditing**
- Implement least-privilege access to secrets
- Track who accessed secrets, when, and what changes were made
- Generate compliance documentation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA)
- Monitor for potential security gaps with vulnerability scanners

**Developer-Friendly Integration**
- Provide CLI tools that integrate with developer workflows
- Sync with CI/CD pipelines for seamless access
- Use environment-based secret injection (avoid hardcoding)
- Make secrets management simple and fast, not complex

2. **Secrets Management** - Automate rotation, never commit to Git, use dedicated tools (96% of orgs struggle with this)
3. **Zero-Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify - for APIs, infrastructure, and all access

### Critical 2025 Security Practices

- **AI-Powered Defense**: Leverage AI-driven anomaly detection for real-time threat identification
- **Supply Chain Security**: 60% of breaches from misconfigurations - use policy-as-code frameworks
- **Rapid Response**: Clusters face attacks within 18-28 minutes - implement immediate security measures
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Manual processes cause breaches - automate creation, rotation, and destruction
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: 48K-59K new CVEs expected in 2025 - continuous vulnerability scanning is critical

**‚ö†Ô∏è Remember**: Security is not a one-time task - it's a continuous process. Stay updated on the latest threats, regularly patch and update systems, and always follow the principle of least privilege.
