# Agent Architect Resources

> Curated GitHub repositories for AI agents and developers building production applications with 2025 best practices.

**Purpose:** Context resources for AI agents using octocode-mcp
**Generated:** October 13, 2025 using octocode-mcp GitHub search
**Enhanced:** October 13, 2025 with 2025 trends, decision guides, and comprehensive reorganization
**Usage:** Reference knowledge base for better AI recommendations and technical decisions

## What This Is

**610+ GitHub repositories** organized into 15 specialized files. Each contains:
- Priority-ordered resources (‚ö° ESSENTIAL, ‚ö° HIGHLY RECOMMENDED at top)
- 2025-specific trends, features, and statistics
- Decision guides and comparison tables for competing technologies
- "Why Essential" and "When to Choose" sections
- Quick Reference summaries with top 3 picks
- Production-ready patterns and best practices

**For AI Agents:** Structured knowledge to provide context-aware suggestions and understand technology ecosystems
**For Developers:** Actionable reference to proven solutions with clear decision frameworks
