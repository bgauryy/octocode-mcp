## Full-Stack Frameworks

### Next.js - THE React Framework

**‚≠ê vercel/next.js** (143,000+ stars) ‚ö° ESSENTIAL
- The React Framework for the Web - Used by Netflix, TikTok, Hulu, Notion, Target, Nike
- üîó https://github.com/vercel/next.js
- **Use Case:** Production-ready React apps, SSR/SSG, SEO-heavy sites, e-commerce, SaaS platforms, AI-powered dashboards

**Why Next.js 15 in 2025:**
- **React 19 Integration:** Full support with streaming UI components as they become ready
- **Partial Prerendering (Stable):** Revolutionary performance - pre-renders only essential parts during build time, dynamic content loads progressively
- **Enhanced Form Component:** Built-in `<Form>` with prefetching, client-side navigation, and progressive enhancement
- **Turbopack in Dev:** Stable release with 15.5+ beta for builds - significantly faster than Webpack
- **Image Optimization:** Automatic format detection (WebP/AVIF), 30% bandwidth reduction
- **App Router:** Modern routing with Server Components, layouts, and nested routes
- **Edge Runtime:** Improved edge support with WebAssembly integration

**2025 Best Practices:**
- Use App Router (not Pages Router) for new projects
- Leverage Server Components for data fetching
- Implement Partial Prerendering for optimal performance
- Write 80%+ test coverage with automated E2E tests
- Use semantic HTML and AA accessibility standards
- Keep state management close to consuming components

**When to Choose Next.js:**
- ‚úÖ You need a flexible framework that scales from MVP to enterprise
- ‚úÖ SEO and performance are critical (e-commerce, media, marketing sites)
- ‚úÖ You want the full React ecosystem with production-grade features
- ‚úÖ You need multiple rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, streaming)
- ‚úÖ You're building SaaS applications or complex web apps
- ‚úÖ Your team is already familiar with React

**When to Choose Alternatives:**
- ‚ùå Content-heavy static sites with minimal interactivity ‚Üí Use **Astro**
- ‚ùå Need edge-native with heavy real-time data handling ‚Üí Use **Remix**
- ‚ùå Want to avoid React entirely ‚Üí Use **SvelteKit**
