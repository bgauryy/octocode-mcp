- **Key Principles:**
  - Test behavior, not implementation details
  - Query components as users would (by text, role, label)
  - Avoid testing internal component state
  - Promote accessibility-friendly selectors
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use `screen` queries for better error messages
  - Prefer `getByRole` and `getByLabelText` queries
  - Use `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for realistic interactions

## Testing Strategies & TDD

### Core Testing Principles (2025)

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern**
   - Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
   - Act: Execute the code being tested
   - Assert: Verify the expected outcome
   - Benefits: Clear structure, easy debugging, consistent format

2. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**
   - Focus on what code does, not how it works
   - Makes tests resilient to refactoring
   - Tests serve as effective documentation
   - Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior

3. **Keep Tests Simple and Readable**
   - Short, flat, and delightful to work with
   - One assertion concept per test
   - Avoid complex setup with beforeEach/beforeAll
   - Use descriptive names for test scenarios

4. **Test Independence**
   - Each test should set up its own state
   - No dependencies between tests
   - Tests should pass in any order
   - Prevents flaky test results

5. **Avoid Overusing Mocks**
   - Mock only external dependencies
   - Prefer real implementations when possible
   - Too many mocks = testing mock behavior
   - Balance between isolation and realism

### The Testing Pyramid

```
        /\
       /E2E\         Small number (10-20%)
      /------\
     /INTEGR.\      Moderate number (20-30%)
    /----------\
   /   UNIT     \   Large number (50-70%)
  /--------------\
```

**Target Coverage:** 70-80% overall (industry benchmark 2025)

### TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)

1. **Red:** Write a failing test first
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor:** Clean up code without changing behavior

**Benefits:**
- Reduces bugs by up to 40%
- Identifies issues early in development
- Improves code design and testability
- Living documentation through tests

### Modern Testing Stack (2025)

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Unit Tests:** Vitest (or Jest for legacy projects)
- **React Components:** React Testing Library + Vitest
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright (or Cypress for SPAs)
- **API Tests:** Vitest with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins

**Emerging Trends:**
- AI-powered test generation and maintenance
- Unified frameworks blending unit/integration/E2E
- Visual and behavioral regression testing
- Component testing in real browsers (Vitest Browser Mode, Playwright Component Tests)
