## What is Octocode? üêô

**The perfect code assistant that can help understand anything.** Octocode provides AI-powered advanced search with heuristic discovery and smart fallbacks to understand connections between repositories and NPM packages across any privilege level you have.

Instead of manually browsing repositories, ask questions like:
- *"How did React implement concurrent rendering?"*
- *"Show me authentication patterns in Next.js applications"*
- *"Find examples of how to use this specific API"*
- *"What's the architecture of this library?"*
- *"How do I use this MCP tool effectively?"*

## Unique Value Proposition

**The most advanced AI-powered code assistant for understanding connections across the entire GitHub & NPM ecosystem.** While other GitHub MCPs focus on project management or basic operations, Octocode provides unparalleled depth for code discovery and technical research.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **üß† AI-Powered Search** - Heuristic algorithms with smart fallbacks that understand code context and find relevant code even with vague queries
- **üîê Zero-Config Security** - Uses GitHub CLI authentication - no personal access tokens needed
- **üîó Connection Intelligence** - Maps NPM packages to repositories, traces dependencies, finds related implementations
- **üåê Universal Access** - Works seamlessly with public, private, and organization repositories
- **‚ö° LLM Optimized** - Advanced content minification and partial fetching reduces token usage by 80-90%

## Quick Start üöÄ

### 1. Install Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js 18.12+
brew install node  # macOS
# or download from https://nodejs.org/

# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh    # macOS
# or see: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
```

### 2. Authenticate
```bash
# Login to GitHub (opens browser)
gh auth login

# Login to NPM (for package research)
npm login
```

**üîê Authentication Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No personal access tokens** - Uses GitHub CLI OAuth flow
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise ready** - Works with SSO, 2FA, and organization access
- ‚úÖ **Automatic organization detection** - Instantly accesses your private repositories
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - Uses existing `gh` CLI permissions

### 3. Choose Your Installation Method

**Option A: Traditional MCP Server** (Add to MCP Configuration)
```json
{
  "octocode-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["octocode-mcp"]
  }
}
```

**Option B: Desktop Extension (DXT)** (Recommended for Claude Desktop)
1. Download the latest `octocode-mcp.dxt` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/releases)
2. Open the `.dxt` file with Claude Desktop (macOS/Windows)
3. Follow the installation prompt

**That's it!** Octocode automatically works with your organization's private repositories.

## DXT Extension üì¶

This project is available as a **Desktop Extension (DXT)** for easy installation in AI applications like Claude Desktop.

### For End Users

**Installation:**
1. Download the latest `octocode-mcp.dxt` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp/releases)
2. Open the `.dxt` file with Claude Desktop (macOS/Windows)
3. Follow the installation prompt - **it's that simple!**

**Benefits of DXT:**
- ‚úÖ **Single-click installation** - No configuration needed
- ‚úÖ **Automatic updates** - Managed by your AI application
- ‚úÖ **Secure packaging** - Signed and verified extensions
- ‚úÖ **No command-line required** - Perfect for non-technical users

### For Developers

**Building the DXT Package:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the DXT package
yarn dxt:pack

# Validate the manifest
yarn dxt:validate

**The DXT package includes:**
- Compiled MCP server (`dist/index.js`)
- Extension manifest (`manifest.json`)
- Package metadata (`package.json`)
- Logo and assets (`assets/logo.png`)
- Documentation (`README.md`)

**Distribution:**
- DXT files are distributed via GitHub Releases
- Users install them directly in AI applications
- NOT published to NPM (different from the MCP server package)

- Ask for connections - "What libraries use this pattern?"
- Cross-ecosystem queries - "NPM packages that implement X"
- Evolution questions - "How has this approach changed?"

**Pro Tips:**
- Let AI guide discovery - vague queries work great
- Trust smart fallbacks - automatic retry with alternatives
- Build on previous searches - maintain context for deeper exploration
- Works everywhere - public, private, and organization repositories

## Troubleshooting üîß

```bash
# Check GitHub CLI status
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth logout && gh auth login

# Check NPM access
npm whoami

# Clear NPX cache if needed
rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx
```

**Common Solutions:**
- No results? Try broader search terms
- Private repos not found? Check `gh auth status` for organization membership
- Windows users? PowerShell is automatically supported
