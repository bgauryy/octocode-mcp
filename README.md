## What is Octocode? 🐙

**The perfect code assistant that can help understand anything.** Octocode was built to understand connections between repositories and NPM packages under any privilege level you have. With **AI-powered advanced search**, heuristic discovery, and smart fallbacks, it makes GitHub's vast repository of knowledge truly searchable and analyzable.

Instead of manually browsing repositories, you can ask questions like:

- *"How did React implement concurrent rendering?"*
- *"Show me authentication patterns in Next.js applications"*
- *"Find examples of how to use this specific API"*
- *"What's the architecture of this library?"*
- *"How do I use this MCP tool effectively?"*

## Recommended Use Cases

**Use Octocode when you need to:**

- **🔍 Understand implementations** - See how features work across different repositories
- **📚 Find real code examples** - Discover patterns and best practices from production code  
- **🏗️ Analyze architecture** - Explore how systems are designed and structured
- **🔬 Research approaches** - Compare different implementation strategies
- **💡 Learn from code** - Deep-dive into technical details and understand "how does this work?"

## Unique Value Proposition

**The most advanced AI-powered code assistant for understanding connections across the entire GitHub & NPM ecosystem.** While other GitHub MCPs focus on project management or basic operations, Octocode provides unparalleled depth for code discovery and technical research.

**🚀 Out-of-the-Box Advanced Search (Powered by AI):**
- **🧠 Heuristic Search** - Intelligent pattern recognition that finds relevant code even with vague queries
- **🔄 Smart Fallbacks** - Automatic retry with alternative search strategies when initial searches fail
- **🎯 Smart Discovery** - AI-guided exploration that uncovers hidden connections and patterns
- **🔗 Connection Intelligence** - Understands relationships between repositories, packages, and dependencies
- **📊 Multi-dimensional Analysis** - Combines code, commits, issues, discussions, and package data

**Key Differentiators:**
- **🧠 Advanced AI Search** - Heuristic algorithms that understand code context and connections
- **🔐 Secure & Simple** - No personal access tokens needed, uses [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) authentication
- **🔗 Connected Discovery** - Maps NPM packages to repositories, traces dependencies, finds related code
- **🌐 Cross-Ecosystem Understanding** - Works across any privilege level you have (public, private, organization)

It's the tool you reach for when you need to understand *"how does this work?"* rather than *"how do I manage this project?"*

## Quick Start 🚀

### 1. Install Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js 21+
brew install node  # macOS
# or download from https://nodejs.org/

# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh    # macOS
# or see: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
```

### 2. Authenticate
```bash
# Login to GitHub (opens browser)
gh auth login

# Login to NPM (for package research)
npm login
```

**🔐 GitHub Authentication via CLI:**
- ✅ **No personal access tokens needed** - Uses [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) behind the scenes
- ✅ **Secure OAuth flow** - Browser-based authentication, no tokens to store
- ✅ **Enterprise ready** - Works with SSO, 2FA, and organization access
- ✅ **Private repository access** - Automatically detects your organizations and accesses private repos
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Uses your existing `gh` CLI permissions


### 3. Add to MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "octocode-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["octocode-mcp"]
  }
}
```

**That's it!** No personal access tokens, no config files, no complex setup. Octocode leverages [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) authentication behind the scenes and **automatically works with your organization's private repositories**.

## Example Questions 💬

**Learning & Research:**
- *"How do popular libraries implement rate limiting?"*
- *"Show me Server Actions patterns in Next.js applications"*
- *"What are the differences between Vue and React rendering?"*

**Architecture & Patterns:**
- *"How is authentication handled in enterprise applications?"*
- *"Show me microservices communication patterns"*
- *"Find examples of event-driven architecture implementations"*

**Organization & Private Repositories:**
- *"Show me authentication patterns used in our team's repositories"*
- *"Find internal libraries and how they're implemented in our org"*
- *"Analyze our company's coding standards and patterns"*

**Specific Code Analysis:**
- *"How does lodash implement debouncing?"*
- *"Show usage examples of this API: `createContext`"*
- *"Find React hooks patterns for data fetching"*

## Core Features 🛠️

## Best Practices 💡

**AI-Powered Search Tips:**
- **Let AI guide you** - Start with natural language questions, the heuristic search will find relevant code
- **Trust the smart fallbacks** - If initial search doesn't work, AI automatically tries alternative strategies
- **Explore connections** - Ask about relationships between packages, libraries, and implementations
- **Use any privilege level** - Works seamlessly across public repos, private repos, and organization repositories
- **Keep research along the MCP** - Build upon previous searches and maintain context across multiple queries for deeper exploration

**Effective Questions:**
- **Vague is OK** - "How does authentication work?" → AI finds relevant patterns across repositories
- **Ask for connections** - "What libraries use this pattern?" → Discovers related implementations
- **Cross-ecosystem queries** - "NPM packages that implement X" → Links packages to their repositories
- **Evolution questions** - "How has this approach changed?" → Traces implementation history

**Advanced Search Features:**
- **Automatic fallbacks** - No need to retry failed searches, AI handles it automatically
- **Smart discovery** - Finds repositories and packages you didn't know existed
- **Connection mapping** - Understands relationships between different codebases
- **Context preservation** - Maintains search context across multiple queries

## Troubleshooting 🔧

**Authentication Issues:**
```bash
# Check GitHub CLI status
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth logout && gh auth login

# Check NPM access
npm whoami
```

**Common Solutions:**
- No results? Try broader search terms
- Private repos not found? Check organization membership with `gh auth status`
- NPX issues? Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`

**🏢 Organization & Private Repository Access:**
- **Automatic detection** - Octocode automatically discovers your GitHub organizations
- **No additional setup** - If you have access to private repos through your organization, they work immediately
- **Verify access** - Run `gh auth status` to see your organization memberships

**Why GitHub CLI Authentication?**
- ✅ **No token creation** - GitHub CLI handles OAuth flow automatically
- ✅ **Enterprise compatible** - Works with SSO, SAML, and 2FA out of the box
- ✅ **Organization auto-detection** - Automatically discovers your GitHub organizations and private repo access
- ✅ **Works out of the box** - If you work for an organization, private repositories are immediately accessible
- ❌ **vs Personal Access Tokens** - No manual creation, rotation, or security risks

## Background 💭

This project started as a personal tool while working at Wix, born from the challenge of navigating large codebases and keeping up with rapidly evolving technology landscapes. What began as a side project to solve daily development challenges evolved into **the perfect code assistant that can help understand anything**.

The goal was simple: **make code exploration as intelligent as having a senior developer guide you through any codebase.** Built specifically to understand connections between many repositories and NPM packages under any privilege the user has, with AI-powered heuristic search, smart fallbacks, and intelligent discovery.
